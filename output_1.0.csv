the
defence
of
their
Asian
Cup
title
with
a
lucky
2-1
win
against
Syria
in
a
Group
C
championship
match
on
Friday
.

But
China
saw
their
luck
desert
them
in
the
second
match
of
the
group
,
crashing
to
a
surprise
2-0
defeat
to
newcomers
Uzbekistan
.

China
controlled
most
of
the
match
and
saw
several
chances
missed
until
the
78th
minute
when
Uzbek
striker
Igor
Shkvyrin
took
advantage
of
a
misdirected
defensive
header
to
lob
the
ball
over
the
advancing
Chinese
keeper
and
into
an
empty
net
.	B	.

Oleg
Shatskiku
made
sure
of
the
win
in
injury
time
,
hitting
an
unstoppable
left
foot
shot
from
just
outside
the
area
.

The
former
Soviet
republic
was
playing
in
an
Asian
Cup
finals
tie
for
the
first
time
.

Despite
winning
the
Asian
Games
title
two
years
ago
,
Uzbekistan
are
in
the
finals
as
outsiders
.

Two
goals
from
defensive
errors
in
the
last
six
minutes
allowed
Japan
to
come
from
behind
and
collect
all
three
points
from
their
opening
meeting
against
Syria
.

Takuya
Takagi
scored
the
winner
in
the
88th
minute
,
rising
to
head
a
Hiroshige
Yanagimoto
cross
towards
the
Syrian
goal
which
goalkeeper
Salem
Bitar
appeared
to
have
covered
but
then
allowed
to
slip
into
the
net
.

It
was
the
second
costly
blunder
by
Syria
in
four
minutes
.

Defender
Hassan
Abbas
rose
to
intercept
a
long
ball
into
the
area
in
the
84th
minute
but
only
managed
to
divert
it
into
the
top
corner
of
Bitar
's
goal
.	B	.

Nader
Jokhadar
had
given
Syria
the
lead
with
a
well-struck
header
in
the
seventh
minute
.	B	.

Japan
then
laid
siege
to
the
Syrian
penalty
area
for
most
of
the
game
but
rarely
breached
the
Syrian
defence
.	B	.

Bitar
pulled
off
fine
saves
whenever
they
did

"
He
ended

"
I
thought
it

is

Two
goals
in
the
last
six
minutes
gave
holders
Japan
an
uninspiring
2-1
Asian
Cup
victory
over
Syria
on
Friday
.	B	.

Takuya
Takagi
headed
the
winner
in
the
88th
minute
of
the
group
C
game
after
goalkeeper
Salem
Bitar
spoiled
a
mistake-free
display
by
allowing
the
ball
to
slip
under
his
body
.

It
was
the
second
Syrian
defensive
blunder
in
four
minutes
.

Defender
Hassan
Abbas
rose
to
intercept
a
long
ball
into
the
area
in
the
84th
minute
but
only
managed
to
divert
it
into
the
top
corner
of
Bitar
's
goal
.	B	.

Syria
had
taken
the
lead
from
their
first
serious
attack
in
the
seventh
minute
.	B	.

Nader
Jokhadar
headed
a
cross
from
the
right
by
Ammar
Awad
into
the
top
right
corner
of
Kenichi
Shimokawa
's
goal
.	B	.

then
laid
siege
to
the
Syrian
penalty
area
and
had
a
goal
disallowed
for
offside
in
the
16th
minute
.

A
minute
later
,
Bitar
produced
a
good
double
save
,

then
blocked
a
Takagi
follow-up
shot

Bitar
saved
well
again
from
Miura
in
the
37th
minute

away
his
header
from

Japan
started
the

half
brightly

denied
them
an
equaliser

with

on

.	B	.

Lara
,
disciplined
for
misconduct
on
Wednesday
,
was
dismissed
for
five
to
extend
a
disappointing
run
of
form
on
tour
.	B	.

Australia
,
who
hold
a
2-0
lead
in
the
five-match
test
series
,
overhauled
West
Indies
'
total
of
172
all
out
with
eight
balls
to
spare
to
end
a
run
of
six
successive
one-day
defeats
.

All-rounder
Greg
Blewett
steered
his
side
to
a
comfortable
victory
with
an
unbeaten
57
in
90
balls
to
the
delight
of
the
42,442
crowd
.

Man-of-the
match
Blewett
came
to
the
wicket
with
the
total
on
70
for
two
and
hit
three
fours
during
an
untroubled
innings
lasting
129
minutes
.

His
crucial
fifth-wicket
partnership
with
fellow
all-rounder
Stuart
Law
,
who
scored
21
,
added
71
off
85
balls
.	B	.

Lara
looked
out
of
touch
during
his
brief
stay
at
the
crease
before
chipping
a
simple
catch
to
Shane
Warne
at
mid-wicket
.	B	.

West
Indies
tour
manager
Clive
Lloyd
has
apologised
for
Lara
's
behaviour
on
Tuesday
.

He
(
Lara
)
had
told
Australia	B	Australia	Australia_national_cricket_team	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team	374833	/m/020wyp
coach	I	Australia	Australia_national_cricket_team	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team	374833	/m/020wyp
Geoff
Marsh
that
wicketkeeper
Ian
Healy
was
unwelcome
in
the
visitors
'
dressing
room
.

The
Melbourne
crowd
were
clearly
angered
by
the
incident
,
loudly
jeering
the
West
Indies
vice-captain
as
he
walked
to
the
middle
.

It
was
left
to
fellow
left-hander
Shivnarine
Chanderpaul
to
hold
the
innings
together
with
a
gritty
54
despite
the
handicap
of
an
injured
groin
.	B	.

Chanderpaul
was
forced
to
rely
on
a
runner
for
most
of
his
innings
after
hurting
himself
as
he
scurried
back
to
his
crease
to
avoid
being
run
out
.	B	.

Pakistan
,
who
arrive
in
Australia
later
this
month
,
are
the
other
team
competing
in

tournament

PRAGUE
1996-12-06

Saturday
's
national
congress
of
the
ruling
Czech
Civic
Democratic
Party
(
ODS	B	ODS	--NME--
)	I	ODS	--NME--
will
discuss
making
the
party
more
efficient
and
transparent
,
Foreign
Minister
and
ODS
vice-chairman
Josef
Zieleniec
,
said
on
Friday
.

"
Modernisation
and
more
profesionalism
of
the
party
's
structure
,
having
financing
of
the
party
be
more
transparent
...

are
absolutely
fundamental
,
"
Zieleniec
,
who
is
also
vice-premier
in
the
government
,
told
Reuters
.

He
said
after
June
general
elections
in
which
the
ruling
three-party
coalition
lost
its
parliamentary
majority
,
the
ODS
executive
,
led
by
Prime
Minister
Vaclav
Klaus
,
had
developed
proposals
on
these
subjects
to
present
at
the
congress
on
Saturday
in
the
Czech
second
city
Brno
.

"
I
am
convinced
,
that
the
congress
will
tackle
these
proposals
,
"
he
said
.

The
ODS
,
a
party
in
which
Klaus
often
tries
to
emulate
the
style
of
former
British
Prime
Minister
Margaret
Thatcher
,
has
been
in
control
of
Czech
politics
since
winning
general
elections
in
1992
.	B	.

Zieleniec
in
the
summer
led
calls
for
the
party
and
its
leadership
to
listen
to
more
diverse
opinions
,
a
thinly-veiled
criticism
of
Klaus
who
has
spearheaded
the
country
's
post-Communist
economic
reforms
.

The
party
,
led
by
the
vigorously-confident
Klaus
,
took
32
of
81
seats
after
late
November
runoff
elections
to
the
new
upper
house
of
Czech
parliament
.

But
after
the
first
round
vote
a
week
before
,
the
ODS
had
the
potential
to
win
as
many
79
seats
.	B	.

Klaus
and
his
coalition
lost
its
majority
in
parliament
in
June
lower
house
elections
after
the
left-wing
opposition
consolidated
,
putting
the
centre-left
Social
Democrats
in
a
strong
second-place
position
.

on
Friday
that
Swiss
bank
accounts
,
which
in
many
cases
belonged
to
Polish
Jews
who
died
in

Holocaust
,
were
used
in

settlements
between

two
countries
after

World

Foreign
Minister
Dariusz
Rosati
,
unveiling
first
findings
of
a
special
government
commission
,
said
that
in

"
In
1970s
,
Poland
received
from
unclaimed
accounts
in
Switzerland
a
sum
of
460,000
francs
.

What
was
its
right
(
to
the
money
)
...I
do
not
know
,
"
Rosati
told
a
news
conference
.	B	.

Switzerland
stands
accused
by
Senator
Alfonse
D'Amato
,
chairman
of
the
powerful
U.S.
Senate
Banking
Committee
,
of
agreeing
to
give
money
to
Poland
from
unclaimed
bank
accounts
of
Polish
citizens
,
as
part
of
an
accord
on
compensating
Swiss
nationals
whose
assets
had
been
seized
in
communist
Poland
.

Many
of
these
citizens
were
Jews
murdered
during
the
war
,
when
Nazi
German
invaders
killed
most
of
Poland
's
3.5
million
Jews
.	B	.

Rosati
did
not
say
whether
the
payment
in
1970s
was
part
of
the
1949
agreement
between
Warsaw
and
Switzerland	B	Switzerland	Switzerland	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland	26748	/m/06mzp

compensation
to
Swiss
citizens
whose
assets
were
seized
by
the
Soviet-imposed
communists
authorities
after
World
War
Two
.

"
I
expect
that
the
commission
will
finish
gathering
information
within
two
to
three
weeks
and
then
more
details
will
be
provided
,
"
Rosati
said
.	B	.

Rosati	B	Rosati	Dariusz_Rosati	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dariusz_Rosati	776028	/m/03bkkh
confirmed	I	Rosati	Dariusz_Rosati	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dariusz_Rosati	776028	/m/03bkkh
that
the
1949
agreement
had
provided
for
granting
Switzerland
about
53
million
francs
and
most
of
this
sum
was
repaid
with
coal
exports
.

He
said
,
however
,
that
Switzerland
did
get
about
16,000
francs
from
the
so-called
"
dead
accounts
"
as
part
of
the
compensation
.

"
About
16,000
francs
were
seized
from
accounts
of
four
or
five
Polish
citizens
,
whose
data
we
do
not
precisely
know
.

The
issue
is
of
moral
and
legal
nature
,
because
its
financial
significance
is
small
,
"
Rosati
said
.

Under
pressure
from
international
Jewish
organisations
,
Swiss
government
has
devised
a
plan
to
pay
out
millions
of
dollars
in
unclaimed
bank
accounts
as
a
conciliatory
gesture
toward
Holocaust
victims
.

The
conservative
Radical
Democrats
(
FDP	B	FDP	Free_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland	369001	/m/020862
)	I	FDP	Free_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland	369001	/m/020862
have
said
they
would
ask
parliament
next
week
to
order
Swiss
banks
to
put
some
40
million
Swiss
francs
(
$
31
million
)
in
dormant
wealth
into
a
fund
earmarked
for
Jewish
groups
and
charitable
organisations
.

But
Swiss
banks
and
the
country
's
Jewish
community
voiced
doubts
whether
the
plan
would
work
.

profit
slump
may
last

due

part
to

,
but
recent
high
investment
should
help
the
firm
defend
its
10-percent
market
share
,
the
firm
's
chief
executive
said
.

Company
President
Jean
van
Boxmeer
told
Reuters	B	Reuters	Reuters	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters	18998750	/m/0ps53
in	I	Reuters	Reuters	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters	18998750	/m/0ps53
an
interview
on
Friday
that
the
firm
,
whose
net
profit
fell
77
percent
in
the
first
10
months
of
1996
despite
a
30-percent
rise
in
sales
,
might
only
post
slightly
better
profits
in
1997
before
having
a
chance
to
make
a
more
significant
turnaround
.

So
far
this
year
Zywiec
,
whose
full
name
is
Zaklady
Piwowarskie
w
Zywcu
SA
,
has
netted
six
million
zlotys
on
sales
of
224
million
zlotys
.

It
has
produced
1.5
million
hectolitres
.	B	.

Van
Boxmeer
would
not
say
how
much
higher
1997
profits
or
market
share
could
be
but
said
sales
of
leading
Polish
brewers
should
rise
as
the
country
's
young
urban
professionals
gradually
switch
from
vodka
to
beer
.

"
The
perspective
on
growth
is
such
that
reasonably
we
can
think
that
somewhere
between
65
and
80
litres

is
certainly
reachable
,
"
van
Boxmeer
said
on
Polish
per-capita
beer
consumption
,
currently
around
40
litres
.

He
said
the
65-80-litre
level
could
be
reached
in
the
next
ten
years
and
make
Poland
,
with
its
40-million
population
,

third
largest

Van
Boxmeer
said
Poland
's
top
five
brewers
,
which
produce
about
55
percent
of
the
country
's
beer
,
could
all
raise
market
share
as
some
of
the
numerous
small
brewers
fall
to
competition
from
the
large
brewers
with
foreign
investors

Van
Boxmeer
said
the
tough
competition
had
prevented
Zywiec
from
raising
prices
in
line
with
inflation
,
which
had
added
to
the
pressure
on
the
firm
's
margins
.

He
said
advertising
costs
would
also
increase
in
the
fight
for
market
share
.

But
he
said
the
company
's
investment
of
more
than
$
100
million
already
this
decade
,
largely
in
production
,
would
help
position
it
to
compete
with
such
competitors
as
brewers
from
the
neighbouring
Czech
Republic
.

Some
analysts
say
cheaper
but
high-quality
Czech
imports
could
invade
Poland
once
tariffs
for
CEFTA
countries
are
lifted
in
1998
,
but
van
Boxmeer
says
such
a
threat
might
be
exaggerated
despite
the
Czech
beer
market
's
overcapacity
.

"
I
think
Polish
consumers
in
general
are
quite
proud
of
their
beers
--
and
I
'm
speaking
about
all
the
brands
--
and
as
we
make
good
beers
...

I
think
that
this
fidelity
to
our
beers
is
a
factor
which
can
limit
the
Czech
beers
,
"
he
said
.	B	.

Van
Boxmeer
said
Zywiec	B	Zywiec	--NME--
had	I	Zywiec	--NME--
its
eye
on
Okocim
,
which
has
said
it
would
start
producing
Carlsberg
beer
next
year
,
but
that
Zywiec
's
potential
production
of
Heineken
was
a
medium-term
possibility
rather
than
a
short-term
one
.

He
said
his
firm
would
be
better
off
concentrating
on
its
leading
brand
,
Zywiec
Full
Light
,
which
accounts
for
85
percent
of
sales
and
is
the
country
's
largest-selling
brand
.

"
You
will
not
win
the
war
of
the
Polish
beer
market
with
imported
international
brands
,
"
van
Boxmeer
said
,
adding
that

would
remain
an
up-market
import
in
Poland
.

Van	B	Van Boxmeer	--NME--
Boxmeer	I	Van Boxmeer	--NME--
also	I	Van Boxmeer	--NME--
said
Zywiec
would
be

by

of

final
clearance
would
hinge
on
an
open

deal

Britain
and
the
United

to
liberalise

,
which
would
create

he
said
.

His
comments
came
just
minutes
after
the
latest
set
of
open
skies
talks
ended
in
London
with
no
deal
signed
.

Industry
sources
said
there
was
no
new
date
for
fresh
talks
and
blamed
the
deadlock
on
uncertainty
over
whether
the
British
Airways-American
deal
would
be
cleared
.

The
conditions
for
clearance
of
the
alliance
were
that
British
Airways
and
American	B	American	United_States	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	3434750	/m/09c7w0
drop	I	American	United_States	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	3434750	/m/09c7w0
168
slots
at
London
Heathrow
airport
,
the
busiest
in
Europe
.

American
's
parent
,
AMR
Corp.
,
said
it
did
not
view
the
terms
as
a
"
deal
breaker
.
"

However
,
it
called
the
conditions
"
more
severe
"
than
those
imposed
by
other
regulatory
authorities
on
similar
airline
alliances
.	B	.

British
Airways
's
initial
response
was
that
"
unconditional
divestiture
of
slots
is
unprecedented
and
if
done
it
must
be
on
the
basis
of
fair
market
value
.
"

It
added
that
it
would
be
"
prepared
to
take
reasonable
steps
to
assist
the
introduction
of
additional
competition
.
"

The
government
also
wants
British
Airways
to
drop
a
clause
in
its
agreement
with
USAir
that
bars
it
from
competing
on
trans-Atlantic
routes
,
and
said
both
British
Airways
and
American
should
be
prepared
to
reduce
services
on
the
London
to
Dallas-Fort	B	Dallas-Fort Worth	--NME--
Worth	I	Dallas-Fort Worth	--NME--
route	I	Dallas-Fort Worth	--NME--
in
the
event
that
a
new
entrant
wishes
to
enter
.

It
also
suggested
losing
some
slots
on
the
London-to-Boston
route
.

The
Office
of
Fair
Trade
called
for

the
disease
in
the
second
such
scare
to
hit
Britain
in
as
many
weeks
,
health
authorities
said
on
Friday

The
16-year-old
who
attended
Sale

in
the
northern
England
city
of

died
less
than
a
day
after

The
15-year-old

is
also
suffering
from
the

described
her

as
serious

At

775
million
refunding
for
January
that
will
include
its
first
floating

issue
of

debt
for

A
city
official
,
who
declined
to
be
named

explained
that
Goldman
,
Sachs	B	Goldman, Sachs	--NME--
,	I	Goldman, Sachs	--NME--
which
this
summer
was
demoted
to
the
second
tier
of
the
syndicate
,
proposed
the
floating
rate
issue
and
as
a
result
was
promoted
to
book
runner
for
this
offering
.

By
selling
the
floating
rate
debt
,
the
city
hopes
to
establish
a
benchmark
,
the
city
official
said
,
adding
that
it
needed
a
large
deal
to
accomplish
this
objective
.

The
city
in
late
June
sold
its
first
issue
of
Euronotes
,
a
strategy
that
it
says
saved
it
$
500,000
in
interest
costs
,
and
it
has
been
trying
to
build
on
this
strategy
of
expanding
the
pool
of
potential
investors
since
then
.

In
November
,
New
York
City
said
it
became
the
first
U.S.
municipality
to
offer
bonds
for
sale
in
European
markets
by
competitive
bidding
as
it
listed
taxable
bonds
on
the
London
Stock
Exchange
.

The
refunding
planned
for
January
also
includes
a
$
475
million
tax-exempt
offering
.

No
specific
date
in
January
has
been
selected
for
the
debt
sale
,
the
official

billion
stock

proposal
from

,
announced
Thursday
.	B	.

Wall

,
since

has
speculated
that
any
deal
between
Newmont
and
Santa	B	Santa Fe	--NME--
Fe	I	Santa Fe	--NME--
would	I	Santa Fe	--NME--
be
a
"

,
"
or
a
reluctantly
negotiated
agreement
where
the
buyer
is
not
necessarily
a
friendly
suitor
.	B	.

Newmont
said
the
companies
have
had
previous
contact
,
though
declined
to
detail
the
encounters
.

Analysts
predict
Santa
Fe
will
go
to
the
highest
bidder
,
and
that
if
a
rival
buyer
is
found
,
Newmont
may
not
be
able
to
match
its
offer
.

They
said
the
Santa
Fe
deal
,
which
includes
desirable
Nevada
mining
territory
,
would
only
payoff
for
Newmont
longer
term
.	B	.

Newmont
,
in
fact
,
will
not
benefit
from
the
Santa
Fe
acquisition
on
an
earnings
basis
for
at
least
two
years
,
which
also
limits
its
capacity
to
raise
its
offer
.

Any
deal
,
friendly
or
hostile
,
would
almost
assuredly
be
a
stock
swap
,
which
is
necessary
to
preserve
the
tax-free

he
lowered
his
rating
on

to
neutral
from

today
because
if

merged
with
Santa
Fe
,
investors
would
have
to
wait
until
the
second
half
of
1998
to
realize
earnings
accretion
.

"
I
think
Homestake
could
come
in
as
a
white
knight
,
but
how
much
is
someone
willing
to
come
in
above
the
Newmont
number
.

One
would
have
to
outbid
by
at
least
15
percent
,
but
there
is
going
to
be
a
(
Santa
Fe
)
deal
with
someone
,
"
he
said
.

"
Longer
term
,
two
to
three
years
out
,
(
a
Newmont-Santa
Fe
deal
)
is
positive
,
it
does
all
the
right
things
.

But
in
the
near-term
it
is
,
at
worst
,
neutral
,
"
the
analyst
added
.	B	.

Newmont
proposed
to
Santa

a
stock-swap
merger
at
a
ratio
of
0.33	B	0.33 Newmont shares

.

"
Newmont
said
it
wants
to
discuss
a
friendly
deal
with
Santa

,
which
is
almost
always
a
euphemism
for

said
an

does

though

)
are
going
to
be
required
in

"
Young
told
reporters
.

But
General
Baril
said
it
would
be
premature
to
rule
out
any
course
of
action
until
he
had
more
information
.

"
We
hope
that
if
the
front
moves
forward
or
stabilises
then
we
will
have
access
(
to
the
large
group
of
refugees
)
with
reconnaissance
or
humanitarian
agencies
.

"
If
they
ca
n't
move
because
they
are
too
weak
,
then
we
will
probably
consider
very
seriously
using
air
delivery
means
(
airdrops
)
...It
's
complex
,
it
's
dangerous
for
the
air
crew
that
fly
in
there
and
it
will
have
to
be
absolutely
necessary
.

If
it
is
necessary
,
I
wo
n't
hesitate
to
use
it
,
"
he
said
.

Asked
if
he
would
disregard
the
objections
of
the
Zairean
government
,
he
said
:
"
It
would
have
to
be
in
the
last
resort
.

It
would
have
to
mean
that
tens
of
thousands
of
lives
are
in
danger
.

Do
you
think
that
I
would
have
a
conscience
problem
doing
it
or
not
at
that
time
?

And
my
mandate
is
also
under
Chapter
Seven
to
operate
in
eastern
Zaire
.
"

Under
Chapter
Seven
of
the
U.N.
charter
,
the
Security
Council
has
wide
powers
to
preserve
peace
and
security
.

"
I
know
their
(
the
Zairean
government
's
)
position
and
I
know
it
's
very
delicate
and
we
are
very
sensitive
to
their
position
also
,
"
the
general
added
.

He
denied
that
his
contacts
,
criticised
by
Kinshasa
,
with
the
Zairean
rebels
amounted
to
negotiations
.

"
I
do
n't
negotiate
,
"
he
said
.
"

I
coordinate
with
those
who
are
holding
ground
and
that
's
a
wise
thing
to
do
.

When
we
do
n't
know
where
the
front
is
,
we
do
n't
know
what
the
risk
is
.
"	B	"

Baril
said
that
apart
from
the
group
of
150,000
,
U.S.
and
British
reconnaissance
plans
had
tracked
two
much
smaller
groups
of
refugees
--
one
of
up
to
1,000
north
of
the
town
of
Masisi
and
one
of
up
to
8,000
on
the
road
from
Bukavu
west
to
Kindu
.

The
Kisangani
office
of
the
medical
charity
Medecins
sans
Frontieres
said
on
Friday
that
more
than
100,000
refugees
were
trekking
northwest
from
the
Goma-Bukavu
area
and
many
of
them
were
now
in
the
town
of

The

did
not

these
refugees

who
are

Dariusz

Rosati
said
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
meeting
,
if
it
takes
place
,
would
largely
depend
on
the
progress
in
talks
on
ratification
of
a
treaty
between
Warsaw
and
the
Vatican
.

@

The
ratification
of
the
treaty
,
which
was
signed
in
1993
by
the
then
right-centrist
government
,
is
being
delayed
by
an
ex-communist
party
,
which
won
parliamentary
elections
in
the
same
year
and
now
dominates
parliament
.

The
party
,
the	B	the Democratic Left Alliance ,
Democratic	I	the Democratic Left Alliance ,

,	I	the Democratic Left Alliance ,
says
the
agreement
would
give
the
Catholic
Church
too
much
influence
over
life
in
Poland
and
could
infringe
on
rights
of
other
religious
groups
and
non-believers
.

The
relations
with
the
Vatican
have
also
been
soured
by
a
recent
relaxation
of
Poland
's
anti-abortion
rules
,
which
Kwasniewski
signed
into

last

"	B	"

Livshits

"

The

quoted
Livshits
as
telling

Nikel
0#NKEL.RUO
had
to
pay
its
tax
arrears
and
that
bankruptcy
procedures
applied
to

.

"
If
it
was
an

out

,
then
it
obviously
means
something
,
"
said
Christopher
Granville
,
chief
economist
at
United
City
Bank
in
Moscow
.

"
But
if
it
was
a
response
to
a
deputy

question
that
was
essentially
loaded
,
then
it
was
the
only
answer
he
could
have
given
.
"	B	"

Russian
tax
and
cabinet
authorities
,
under
pressure
from
the
International
Monetary
Fund
to
boost
tax
revenues
as
a
condition
for
receiving
payments
of
a
$
10
billion
,
three-year
loan
to
Moscow
,
have
been
striking
fear
into
the
hearts
of
some
of
Russia
's
most
prominent
industrial
firms
by
saying
they
must
pay
up
or
face
liquidation
.

"
They
could
freeze
metal
,
but
it
's
not
a
long-term
solution
to
the
problem
and
would
n't
put
money
in
the
budget
,
"
Chernyshev
said
.
"

I
do
n't
think
they
would
do
that
.
"

Entire
social
infrastructures
in
the
icy
Far
North
where
Norilsk	B	Norilsk	--NME--
is	I	Norilsk	--NME--
based
depend
on
the
company
,
and
Moscow
has
said
it
has
no
finances
to
resettle
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
--
an
expenditure
which
could
far
outstrip
Norilsk
's
debts
.	B	.

Norilsk
officials
declined
to
comment
.

Analysts
said
the
government
,
while
anxious
about
Norilsk
's
debts
,
is
highly
unlikely
to
bring
the
nickel
,
copper
,
cobalt
,
platinum
and
platinum
group
metals
producer
to
its
knees
or
take
measures
that
could
significantly
affect
output
.

But
it
also
wants
Norilsk
,
the
world
's
second-largest
nickel
producer
,
to
clean
up
its
act
.

"
The
procedure
of
bankruptcy
will
be
applied
,
"
Tass
quoted
Livshits	B	Livshits	--NME--
as	I	Livshits	--NME--
telling
Duma
deputies
about
Norilsk
.

It
indirectly
quoted
him
as
saying
Norilsk
should
first
pay
salary
arrears
,
which
in
the
past
have
led
to
worker
strikes
.

"
It
is
unlikely
that
Norilsk
will
pay
these
debts
in
the
near-term
--
the
company
will
remain
a
debtor
in
the
near
future
,
"
Chernyshev
said
.

He
estimated
the
company
's
regional
debts
at
least
one
trillion
roubles
and
said
30
percent
of
the
giant
Krasnoyarsk
regional
budget
was
fuelled
by
Norilsk
money
.	B	.

Norilsk
's
new
majority
shareholder
,
Russian
commerical
bank
Uneximbank
,
has
said
it
is
reorganising
metal
exports
through
Interrosimpex
in
order
to
boost
revenues
.

But
the
changes
have
yet
to
improve
significantly
Norilsk
's
situation
.

"
Uneximbank
has
inherited
a
mountain
and
whether
or
not
they
climb
out
and
over
it
remains
to
be
seen
,
"
said
one
metals
source
.	B	.

Norilsk
said
in
September
that
it
total
debts
,
including
unpaid
salaries
to
workers
,
were
13
trillion
roubles
.

The
company
said
last
month
that
it
had
worked
out
a
tax
payment
schedule
with
authorities
,
after
regional
tax
officials
threatened
to
seize
some
nickel
and
copper
assets
.

Plastic
surgery
gets
boost
in
Brazil
.

Simona

RIO
DE
JANEIRO
1996-12-06

Plastic
surgery
is
booming
,
especially
among
men
,
as
Brazilians
spend
much
of
their
new-found
wealth
on
the
latest
beauty
treatments
,
said
the
organisers
of
a
four-day
international
plastic
surgery
conference
that
opened
on
Friday
.

The
number
of
plastic
surgeries
in
Brazil
has
jumped
30
percent
to
an
estimated
150,000
this
year
since
an
anti-inflation
plan
was
introduced
in
July
1994
,
Farid
Hakme
,
the
president
of
the
Brazilian
Plastic
Surgery
Society
(
SBCP	B	SBCP	--NME--
)	I	SBCP	--NME--
,
said
.

The
number
of
operations
on
men
increased
even
more
--
by
80
percent
,
from
8,000
in
1994
to
15,000
in
1995
,
he
said
.

"
Brazil
ranks
right
at
the
top
for
plastic
surgery
with
respect
to
the
number
of
surgeons
,
the
number
of
patients
,
number
of
operations
,
number
of
conferences
.

Our
statistics
are
the
highest
for
everything
,
"
Hakme
said
.

"
We
believe
the
increase
in
plastic
surgeries
for
men
results
from
the
difficulties
in
the
job
market
.

People
need
to
have
a
more
youthful
look
to
compete
in
the
job
market
,
given
the
profound
changes
in
Latin
America
's
economy
.
"

A
controlled
exchange
rate
,
trade
liberalisation
and
tight
monetary
policies
have
also
dramatically
curbed
inflation
,
making
more
money
available
for
cosmetic
surgery
.	B	.

Brazil
has
been
at
the
forefront
in
plastic
surgery
for
decades
and
is
home
to
one
of
the
most
famous
surgeons
,
Ivo
Pitangy
.

There
are
6,000
plastic
surgeons
there
,
of
which
4,500
have
qualified
to
be
members
of
the
SBCP
.

Every
year
,
500
new
plastic
surgeons
graduate
in
Brazil
and
medical
students
from
all
over
the
world
come
to
study
there
.	B	.

Hakme
attributes
Brazil
's
fascination
with
plastic
surgery
not
to
excessive
vanity
but
to
the
country
's
mix
and
match
of
different
races
,
which
can
create
physical
disharmonies
.
"

What
happens
is
the
nose
sometimes
does
n't
match
the
mouth
or
the
buttocks
do
n't
match
with
the
legs
,
"
he
said
.	B	.

Brazil
's
most
sought-after
beauty
treatment
is
liposuction
in
which
fat
is
sucked
away
from
areas
of
the
body
,
with
about
30,000
operations
a
year
at
a
cost
of
$
3,000
to
$
4,000
each
.

Stomach
tucks
and
breast
operations
are
also
popular
since
the
tropical
climate
calls
for
flesh-baring
fashions
,
but
unlike
women
elsewhere
Brazilians
tend
to
have
breast
reductions
and
buttock
implants
.

"
The
women
who
want
to
reduce
their
breasts
here
would
probably
want
to
increase
them
in
the
United
States
,
"
SBCP
Vice-President
Oswaldo
Saldanha
said
.
"

Beauty
ideals
and
cultures
are
different
in
every
country
.
"

Plastic
surgery
scares
like
the
case
in
which
Brazilian
model
Claudia	B	Claudia Liz	--NME--
Liz	I	Claudia Liz	--NME--
fell	I	Claudia Liz	--NME--
into
a
coma
after
being
anaesthetised
for
a
liposuction
in
October
are
not
much
of
a
deterrent
.	B	.

Saldanha
said
operations
fell
30
percent
immediately
after
that
case
but
the
rate
was
back
to
normal
now

told

One
of
two
roads
leading
to
the

from

had
been
closed
by
authorities
.

But
about
300
university
students
were
still
gathered
outside
the
gates
of
their

,
witnesses
said
.

They
were
singing
peacefully
.

On
Monday
and
Tuesday
,
students
from
the
institute
and
the
university
launched
protests
against
what
they
said
was
unfair
handling
by
police
of
a
brawl
between
some
of
their
colleagues
and
restaurant
owners
in
October
.

On
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
,
opposition
leader
Aung
San
Suu

was
restricted
to
her
home
by
the
military
government
to
prevent
her
from
being
drawn
into
the
protests
.

She
was
allowed
to
move
freely
on
Thursday
.

The
protest
culminated
at
dawn
on
Tuesday
with
several
hundred
students
being
detained
briefly
by
police
in
central
Rangoon
.

The
street
protests
were
the
biggest
seen
in
the
capital
since
the
student-led
pro-democracry
demonstrations
of
September
1988
when
the
junta
crushed
the
uprising
.

Thousands
were
killed
or
imprisoned
.

Earlier
on
Friday
some
of
the
students
,
who
were
held
briefly
by
police
during
the
protests
earlier
this
week
,
said
they
were
still
dissatisfied
with
the
military
government
.

told

they
were
unhappy
that
the

,
the
chairman
of
the
Rubber
Board
of
India
said
on
Friday
.	B	.

K.J.
Matthew
said
at
the
Asia
Rubber
Markets
meeting
here
Indian
production
of
natural
rubber
in
1996/97
will
reach
547,000
tonnes
against
projected
demand
of
578,000
tonnes
,
a
gap
of
31,000
tonnes
.

For
synthetic
rubber
,
production
reached
68,200
tonnes
in
1995/96
while
consumption
in
the
same
season
hit
134,085
tonnes
,
Matthew
added
.

"
Though
schemes
designed
to
realise
further
increases
in
the
production
of
natural
rubber
are
being
operated
successfully
,
the
demand-supply
gap
is
expected
to
widen
,
"
he
said
.	B	.

Indian
synthetic
rubber
output
is
not
expected
to
rise
significantly
in
the
next
season
but
demand
will
rise
to
145,000
tonnes
.	B	.

Matthew
estimates
that
by
the
2000/01
season
,
the
gap
between
natural
rubber
output
and
consumption
will
rise
to
51,000
tonnes
and
319,000
tonnes
in
2010/11
.

Natural
rubber
production
will
go
up
to
695,000
tonnes
in
2000/01
against
consumption
of
746,000
tonnes
.

In
2010/11
,
domestic
demand
should
rise
further
to
1.233
million
tonnes
while
production
will
only
reach
about
914,000
tonnes
.

One
way
to
bridge
the
widening
gap
is
to
put
more
land
under
cultivation
which
the
Rubber
Board
official
estimates
will
reach
220,000
hectares
between
now
and
the
year
2003
although
Matthew
said
this
may
not
be
possible
at
this
time
in
India
.

"
The
development
objective
for
the
rubber
plantation
industry
will
be
to
increase
production
to
the
best
extent
possibly
with
a
view
to
minimising
imports
of
natural
rubber
,

governor
,
Yasuo
Matsushita
was
quoted
in
Japan
's
leading
economic
daily
on
Friday
as
saying
that
he
sees
no
further
,
immediate
fall
in
the
yen
.

This
followed
a
widely
watched
television
appearance
late
on
Thursday
by
Eisuke
Sakakibara
,
a
high-ranking
Finance
Ministry
official
,
who
denied
he
had
said
he
wants
to
guide
the
dollar
lower
to
between
108
and
110
yen
.

But
many
in
the
market
thought
Sakakibara
's
real
intentions
lay
elsewhere
,
and
took
more
notice
of
his
comments
about
the
U.S.
government
's
stance
on
the
dollar
,
dealers
said
.

"
I
think
his
views
on
(
U.S.
Treasury
Secretary
Robert
)
Rubin
's
comments
were
indeed
what
he
himself
thinks
about
the
dollar
,
"
said
Hank
Note
,
chief
dealer
at
Sumitomo
Bank
.

Rubin
's
comment
that
a
strong
dollar
was
in	B	in U.S. interests
U.S.	I	in U.S. interests
interests	I	in U.S. interests
,
Sakakibara
said
the
remark
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
United
States
supports
a
stronger
dollar
.

"
It
's
a
strong
dollar
,
not
stronger
.

In
that
sense
,
the
comments
are
not
pointing
to
a
certain
direction
,
"
he
said
.

"
It
shows
that
Sakakibara
is
not
for
a
stronger
dollar
either
,

,	I	Tokyo	Tokyo	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo	30057	/m/07dfk
said
:
"
Maybe
a
dollar
at
104.50
yen
is
not
acceptable
(
to
Sakakibara
)
,
but
it
may
be
okay
at
the
current
level
,
at
the
lower
end
of
112
yen
.
"

Market
participants
have
kept
a
close
eye
on
Sakakibara
,
chief
of
the
ministry
's
International
Finance
Bureau
,
as
a
comment
he
made
in
November
after
the
dollar
hit
this
year
's
high
of
114.92
yen
pushed
the
currency
down
sharply
.

He
had
said
then
that
the
market
's
view
on
Japan
's
economy
was
too
pessimistic
and
that
he
believed
it
was
stronger
than
the
market
thought
.

Dealers
have
come
to
refer
to
115
yen
as
the
"
Sakakibara
ceiling
"
for
the
dollar
following
the
remark
.

Adding
to
the
comments
by
"
Mr
Yen
"
,
as
Sakakibara
is
known
for
his
prominence
in
the
currency
market
,
was
BOJ
governor
Matsushita
's
remark
.

"
The
recent
level
of
the
yen
exchange
rate
has
been
stable
,
and
it
does
not
appear
to
be
moving
towards
a
further
depreciation
of
the
yen
immediately
,
so
import
prices
are
likely
to
stabilise
at
current
levels
,
"
Matsushita
said
in
an
interview
with
the	B	the Nihon Keizai Shimbun .
Nihon	I	the Nihon Keizai Shimbun .

"
The
fact
that
he
touched
on
the
issue
of
inflation
triggered
by
import
prices
shows
that
the
BOJ
does
not
want
a
further
depreciation
of
the
yen
,
past
115
yen
,
"
said
Yasuhito
Kawashima
,
chief
forex
manager
at

Co
.

Some
said
the
central
bank
may
have
been
concerned
a
weaker
yen
would
lead
to
unfounded
pessimism
about
Japan
's
economy
.

"
There
was
concern
that
foreign
investors
may
sell

stocks
if
the

goes
above

A
Lebanese
military
court
on
Friday
sentenced
to
death
in
absentia
the
commander
of
Israel
's
surrogate
militia
in
south
Lebanon
on
treason
charges
.

The
court
convicted
General
Antoine
Lahd
,
head
of
the
South
Lebanon
Army
(
SLA	B	SLA	South_Lebanon_Army	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lebanon_Army	1224174	/m/04jxrg
)	I	SLA	South_Lebanon_Army	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lebanon_Army	1224174	/m/04jxrg
,
of
collaborating
with
Israel
with
which
Lebanon
is
officially
at
war
.	B	.

Lahd
,
a
69-year-old
former
Lebanese
army
major-general
,
heads
the
3,000-strong
SLA
militia
which
helps
Israel
hold
a
border
zone
in
south
Lebanon
to
ward
off
cross-frontier
guerrilla
raids
on
northern
Israel
.

Lahd	B	Lahd	--NME--
said	I	Lahd	--NME--
a
few
days
after
the
trial
began
on
February
16
that
Lebanese
authorities
must
drop
the
charges
or
risk
blocking
any
peace
deal
with
the
Jewish
state
.

He
said
Israel
was
capable
of
pressuring
Lebanon
's
Syrian-backed	B	Syrian-backed	--NME--
government	I	Syrian-backed	--NME--
to
stop
the
legal
pursuit
.

The
charges
against
Lahd
were
:
forming
a
hostile
army
,
carrying
weapons
on
Israel
's
side
,
helping
Israel
strip
off
a
part
of
Lebanese
territory
by
violence
,
forming
an
armed
gang
,
killing
or
trying
to
kill
Lebanese
civilians
by
artillery
shelling
and
kidnapping
Lebanese
citizens
for
long
periods
.

Shortly
before
Lahd
's
trial
began
,
a
Beirut
military
prosecutor
charged
another
89
former
Lebanese
army
soldiers
with
collaborating
with
Israel
.

No
date
has
been
set
for
the
trial
of
the
men
,
all
members
of
the
SLA
living
in
the
Israeli-held
zone
in
south
Lebanon
.

Lahd	B	Lahd	--NME--
have	I	Lahd	--NME--
repeatedly
demanded
safety
guarantees
for
the
SLA
--
a
mixed
Christian-Shi'ite
Moslem
force
--
which
the
Jewish
states
regards
as
loyal
allies
.	B	.

Israel
has
said
the
Lebanese
army
must
incorporate
the
SLA
fighters
into
its
ranks
as
an
army
brigade
as
a
condition
for
peace
.

But
Lebanese
political
analysts
have
said
that
would
be
out
of
the
question
and
Lebanese
authorities
pre-empted
the
issue
by
taking
legal
action
against
Lahd
.

Former
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Shimon
Peres
,
calling
Lahd
"
a
great
Lebanese
patriot
"
,
said
earlier
this
year
Lebanon
had
insulted
the
SLA
commander
by
ordering
his
arrest
on
the
treason
charges
.	B	.

Peres
,
who
was
ousted
in
May
by
rightwing
Israeli
leader
Benjamin
Netanyahu
,
said
there
could
not
be
real
negotiations
with
Lebanon
"
unless
it
will
stop
the
maltreatment
of
the
SLA
and
its
commanders
.
"

The
Beirut
military
court
also
sentenced
to
life
in
jail
in
absentia
Etian
Saqr
,
former
head
of
the
pro-Israeli
Guardians
of
the
Cedars
,

Saqr
,
whose
trial
was
concurrent
with
Lahd

,
was
convicted
of
"

Israeli
enemy

passing
information
to
Israel
and
undertaking
hostile
acts
against

Fourteen

whose

,
John
Mills
Jr
.

,

,
was
put
to
death
in
Florida
's
electric
chair
Friday
.

As
Glenn
Lawhon
,
a
rural
Florida
minister
who
is
the
victim
's
father
,
looked
on
,
Mills
was
pronounced
dead
at
7:13
a.m.
EST
(
1213
GMT
)
for
the
murder
of
Lester
Lawhon
.

Speaking
in
Arabic
,
Mills
made
a
final
statement
before
an
anonymous
citizen
flipped
the
switch
that
sent
2000
volts
of
electricity
through
his
body
,
said
Department
of

Morris
,
who
was
present
at
the
execution
.

"
I
bear
witness
that
there
is
no
God
but
Allah
and
I
bear
witness
that
the
prophet
Mohammed
is
the
messenger
of
God
,
"
he
quoted
Mills
as
saying
.

Prison
officials
said
they
had
no
record
of
Mills
'
official
conversion
,
but
they
said
that
,
on
May
14
,

,
he
had
asked
that
a
new
name
,
Yuhanna
Abdullah
Muhammed
,
be
added
to
his
prison
file
,
which
is
usually
an
indication
of
a
conversion
to
Islam
.

Mills
is
the
38th
person
to
die
in
Florida
's
electric
chair
since
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
reversed
itself
in
1976
and
legalised
the
death
penalty
.

Prison

made
no

request
for
a
last
meal
and
did
not
eat
the
steak
,
fried
potatoes
and

him

He
spent
Thursday

meeting
of
the
American
Veterinary
Medical
Association
.

"
Let
's
not
let
our
kids
jump
on
them
or
crawl
on
them
.

Dogs
and
children
do
n't
have
to
have
an
interaction
.

Let
's
respect
their

,
"
he
said
.	B	.

Cornwell
said
50
percent
of
reported
bites
were
provoked
by
a
person
and
60
percent
were
suffered
by
children
.

He
also
estimated
that
only
25
percent
of
bites
were
reported
because
medical
attention
was
not
needed
.	B	.

Don
Rieck
,
president
of
the
National
Animal
Control
Association
,
said
aggressiveness
in
dogs
was
related
more
to
gender
than
breed
and
a
male
dog
that
had
not
been
neutered
was
three
times
more
likely
to
bite
than
an
unspayed
female
.

The
five
breeds
credited
with
the
most
incidents
were
chow
chows
,	B	, Rottweilers ,
Rottweilers	I	, Rottweilers ,
,	I	, Rottweilers ,
German
shepherds
,
cocker
spaniels
and
Dalmatians
.
"

The
trends
in
dog
bites
by
particular
breeds
have
more
to
do
with
fad
pets
owned
by
individuals
who
need
to
have
something
unique
.

Speaking
strictly
of
dogs
,
15
years
ago
the
macho
fad
pet
was
a
Doberman
.

Today
,
Rottweilers
are
on
the
way
up
,
"
Rieck
said
.

If
approached
by
a
stray
dog
,
children
should
be
taught
to
stand
still
with
fists
folded
underneath
the
neck
,
elbows
in
,
and
gaze
forward
until
the
dog
goes
away

prison
of

Palestinian
guerrilla
convicted
of
bombing
an
airliner
and
killing
a

in

move
"
does

"

'	B	'

Mohammed
Rashid
"
is
a
terrorist
who
deserves
to
be
behind
bars
.

It
is
inexplicable
to
us
why
he
would
have
been
allowed
to
leave
Greece
before
serving
his
just
sentence
...
This
is
an
incomprehensible
move
.

It
does
not
make
sense
,
"
Burns
told
a
news
briefing
.

He
spoke
after
Rashid
left
Greece
Thursday
on
being
freed
from
prison
early
for
good
behaviour
after
serving
8-1/2
years
.

The
Clinton
administration
's
strong
views
on
this
subject

Mahammad

from

the
airport
where
he
boarded

was
sentenced
to
18
years

by

court
in

after
being
convicted
of
premeditated
murder
in
the
mid-air
bombing
of
a
Pan
American
airliner
in
1982
.

His
sentence
had
been
reduced
to
15
years
in
1993
.

A
parole
court
ruled
recently
that
Rashid
could
be
freed
after
serving
8-1/2
years
,
with
time
in
pre-trial
detention
counted
towards
his
term
,
but
said
he
must
be
expelled
immediately
from

.

The

accuses

of	I	Rashid	--NME--
belonging

1996-12-06	I	GENEVA	Geneva	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva	12521	/m/03902

In
a
gloomy
Geneva
conference
centre
built
before
the
dawn
of
the
Internet
,
groups
of
staid
officials
made
a
first
stab
on
Friday
at
rewriting
copyright
laws
for
the
digital
age
.

But
critics
at
the
first
government-level
meeting
to
revise
copyright
laws
in
25
years
said
the
officials
and
legislators
might
as
well
be
trying
to
police
the
ether
.

After
four
days
of
diplomatic
wrangling
over
procedures
,
some
600
delegates
from
nations
small
and
large
got
down
to
the
nitty-gritty
of
setting
the
digital
agenda
for
the
first
time
.

Cyberspace
squabbles
overshadowed
the
debate
on
a
stack
of
proposals
covering
literary
and
artistic
works
,
the
rights
of
performers
and
producers
of
music
and
producers
of
databases
.

"
If
it
goes
on
like
this
,
we
wo
n't
have
enough
time
to
finish
all
the
discussions
,
"
a
frustrated
Western
delegate
said
.
"

They
announced
they
will
start
evening
sessions
next
week
.
"

Attempts
by
copyright-based
industries
to
ensure
they
get
a
cut
from
online
works
led
to
a
storm
of
protests
by
Internet
companies
and
critics
who
say
the
pacts
would
curb
public
access
to
online
information
from
soccer
results
to
stock
prices
.

"
It
's
not
illegal
to
make
photocopies
of
newspaper
articles
.

It
's
fair
use
.

We
can
read
sports
statistics
or
stock
prices
.

But
with
the
treaty
,
this
kind
of
fact
will
be
owned
and
subject
to
licensing
,
"
said
James
Love
,
a
consumer
lobbyist
heading
the
Washington-based
Consumer
Project
on
Technology
.

"
None
of
the
treaties
are
ready
to
move
.

These
people
do
n't
understand
what
they
're
doing
.
"

At
stake
are
billions
of
dollars
and
the
future
of
the
electronic
information
industry
--
the
coming
medium
for
the
distribution
of
music
,
films
,
literature
,
software
and
commerce
.

Supporters
of
the
three
pacts
say
they
are
only
an
extension
of
existing
intellectual
property
rights
,
covered
by
the
century-old
Berne
Convention
.

But
an
array
of
opponents
from
the
network
industry
to
consumer
,
scientific
and
academic
groups
say
the
pacts
will
give
sweeping
powers
to
entertainment
and
copyright-based
industries
.

A
quick
survey
at
the
conference
centre
found
few
officials
who
had
actually
surfed
the
Internet
.

Mongolia
's
state
copyright
official
,
Gundegma
Jargalshaihan
,
said
apologetically
that
he
had
just
arrived
from
Ulan
Bator
and
was
not
aware
of
the
details
of
the
digital
agenda
.

"
We
do
n't
have
money
for
Internet
in
Mongolia
,
"
he
added
.	B	.

Alexander
Bavykin
,
deputy
legal
chief
at
Russia
's
foreign
ministry
,
said
Moscow
had
yet
to
formulate
a
policy
on
copyright
in
cybersppace
.

He
too
had
never
browsed
the
Net
.

"
I
've
never
tried
it
and
why
should
I
?

There
are
lots
of
other
things
in
this
life
I
have
n't
tried
either
,
"
he
said
.

A
visit
to
the
computer
centre
offering
Internet
services
found
a
lone

ejects
head

Australian
child-sex
inquiry
.	B	.

CANBERRA
1996-12-06

The
Australian
opposition
on
Friday
demanded
a
high-powered
investigation
into
paedophilia
in
the
Australian
diplomatic
service
after
the
federal
court
forced
the
head
of
the
existing
inquiry
to
stand
aside
.

The
court
said
inquiry
head
Chris
Hunt
might
be
biased
,
since
he
privately
told
a
newspaper
he
had
turned
up
no
major
evidence
of
paedophile
activity
,
even
though
he
still
had
months
'
of
investigation
before
him
.

"
Today
we
are
left
with
a
ruinous
wreck
beyond
salvage
and
a
continuing
pall
of
doubt
and
suspicion
hanging
over
our
diplomatic
service
,
"
opposition
foreign
affairs
spokesman
Laurie
Brereton
said
.

But
the
government
responded
by
pressing
ahead
with
the
original
inquiry
,
established
in
May
,
appointing
a
new
head
to
lead
it
.

Critics
say
that

took

the

"
said

"
Singapore
stands
to
benefit
more

from

Singapore

of

"
carries

symbolism
for
the

,
underscoring
its
commitment
to
free
trade
and
its
trading
links
across
the

.
"

There
is
the
international
prestige
Singapore
would
enjoy
,
but
"
more
importantly
there
is
a
genuine
national
interest
in
fostering
better
global
free

and
an
open

"
,
said
Tan
Kong
Yam
,
head
of

Policy
at

National
University
of

.

At
the
ministerial
meeting
,
trade
ministers
will
review
the
work
of
the
WTO
and
the
implementation
of
the
Uruguay
Round
free
trade
commitments
under
its
predecessor
the
General
Agreement
on
Tariffs
and
Trade
(
GATT
)
.

In
June
,
the
WTO
hailed
Singapore	B	Singapore	Singapore	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore	27318	/m/06t2t
for	I	Singapore	Singapore	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore	27318	/m/06t2t
its
open
market
policies
but
the
European
Union
and
other
trading
powers
called
on
Singapore
to
speed
up
the
opening
of
its
services
sector
.	B	.

Supple
said
the
struggle
that
Singapore
had
to
wage
in
vying
to
host
the
meeting
would
be
repeated
during
the
talks
.

"
There
is
tension
at
every
step
of
the
way
,
"
since
a
battle
line
between
the
West
and
developing
countries
has
been
drawn
over
the
issue
of
linking
trade
liberalisation
with
labour
rights
,
he
said
.	B	.

Supple
said
hosting
the
meeting
carried
prestige
for
Singapore
,
"
however
,
this
is
quite
intangible
as
the
prestige
factor
may
not
necessarily
lead
to
any
additional
investment
and
trade
flows
to
this
region
.
"

From
a
commercial
point
of
view
,
the
meeting
would
be
good
for
Singapore
's
tourism
industry
,
Tan
said
.

A
large
part
of
Singapore
's
workforce
would
be
mobilised
to
ensure
the
meeting
would
run
without
a
glitch
but
the
average
Singaporean
"
would
probably
not
be
too
concerned
about
some
of
the
issues
,
"
Tan
said
.

"
But
the
more
educated
public
will
realise
that
these
kind
of
things
are
important
for
Singapore
as
a
small
economy
.
"	B	"

Supple
said
any
political
gains
the
Singapore
government
would
get
from
the
WTO
meeting
--
ahead
of
a
general
election
due
by
April
1997
--
would
depend
on
how
successful
it
was
in
pushing
its
economic
agenda
.

"
If
there
are
any
movements
toward
freer
trade
,
then
Singapore
's
economy
and
the
electorate
would
gain
,
"
he
said
.
"

But
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
wise
to
play
up
the
political
aspect
of
this
.

I
think
political
issues
will
take
secondary
importance
to
all
these
economic
issues
that
will
be
displayed

"
I

much
of
the

"
he
said
.
"

I
came
here
on
zero
and
left
at

(
aged

when
my
father
was
transferred
to
Calcutta
where
I
spent
another
four

half
years
.

"
But
I
do
remember
we
had
a
cobra
snake
in
the
basement
of
our
house
.

Also
that
my
father
bought
a
bicycle
and
when
we
rode
over
a
hose
pipe
it
broke
into
two
.

Woolmer
said
the
hospital
where
he
was
born
is
close

in
at

one
men
's
downhill
training
run
on
Saturday
in
an
effort
to
salvage
the
weekend
racing
programme
.

For
the
third
consecutive
day
,
Friday
's
scheduled
training
runs
were
cancelled
due
to
heavy
wet
snow
and
fog
on
Whistler
Mountain
,
leaving
the
scheduled
World
Cup
events
in
jeopardy
.

Rules
call
for
at
least
one
training
run
to
be
completed
before
a
World
Cup
downhill
race
can
be
staged
.

Organisers
hope
to
get
that
run
in
on
Saturday
morning
,
conditions
permitting
,
and
stage
the
race
later
in
the
day
or
on
Sunday
.

"
There
was
no
possibility
today
to
make
a
training
run

the
Canadian
men
's

,
citing
too
much
new

and
poor
visibility
.

If
organisers
are
forced
to
run
the
downhill
on
Sunday
,
the
super-giant
slalom
originally
scheduled
for
Sunday
would
likely
be

"
If
the
opportunity
is
there
I
'd
obviously
think
about
it
but
the
thing
that
holds

is
business

said
Campese
.

"
I
'd
like
to
come
over
but
there
are
a
lot
of
things
happening
at
home
.

I
've
also
got
a
contract
to
play
for
New
South
Wales
in
the
Super
12
next
year

may	I	Campese	David_Campese	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Campese	1586411	/m/05djx3
yet
be
tempted
to
England
.

"
I
'm
sure
there
are
a
few
people
in

who
'd
be
delighted
to
have
David

their
club

jersey

farewell
to
David
Campese
in
spectacular
fashion
by
overwhelming
the
Barbarians
39-12
in
the
final
match
of
their
European
tour
at
Twickenham
on
Saturday
.

The
Wallabies
ran
in
five
tries
with
Campese
,
who
has
retired
from
test
rugby
after
collecting
101
caps
and
a
world
record
64
tries
,
adding
one
last
touchdown
in
a
Wallaby
jersey
before
departing
the
international
game
.

The
Barbarians
included
14
internationals
but
,
with
only
two
pre-match
practice
sessions
behind
them
,
proved
no
real
match
for
a
Wallaby
side
determined
to
finish
their
12-match
tour
unbeaten
.

The
touring
team
were
27-0
ahead
by
half-time
before
easing
up
in
the
second-half
.

Full-back
Matthew
Burke
finished
with
a
personal
haul
of
24
points
to
take
his
tour
aggregate
to
136
.

was
suspended
for

and
fined
$
1,000
Friday
for
his
hit
on
Buffalo
Sabres
defenceman
Garry
Galley
on
Wednesday
.	B	.

Bure
received
a
double-minor
penalty
for
high-sticking
with
2:22
left
in
the
first
period
of
Wednesday
's
7-6
overtime
win
by
Vancouver
after
colliding
with
Galley
in
Buffalo
zone
.	B	.

Galley
suffered
a
concussion
and
did
not
return
to
the
game
.

"
Mr
Bure
left
his
feet
to
deliver
a
forearm
blow
to
Mr
Galley
as
he
was
about
to
be
checked
legally
by
his
opponent
,
"
said
NHL
discipline
chief
Brian
Burke
in
handing
out
the
suspension
.

"
Although
it
is
clear
from
the
videotape
that
Mr
Bure
's
actions
were
a
reaction
to
the
impending
hit
and
there
was
no
intent
to
injure
his
opponent
,
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
this
type
of
conduct
,
"
Burke
said
.	B	.

Bure
,
who
is
struggling
with
only
nine
goals
and
12
assists
in
26
games
,
will
miss

home
game
against

"
The
years
I
spent
as
manager
of
the
Republic
of
Ireland
were
the
best
years
of
my
life
.

It
all
culminated
in
the
fact
that
I
now
have
lots
of
great
,
great
friends
in
Ireland
.

That
is
why
this
is
so
emotional
a
night
for
me
,
"
Charlton
said

"
It
was
the
joy
that
we
all
had
over
the
period

that
I
shared
with
people
that
I
grew
to
love
,
that
I
treasure
most
