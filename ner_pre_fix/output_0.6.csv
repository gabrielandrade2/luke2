Japan	B	Japan	Japan_national_football_team	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_national_football_team	993546	/m/03xh50
began
the
defence
of
their
Asian
Cup
title
with
a
lucky
2-1
win
against
Syria
in
a
Group
C
championship
match
on
Friday
.

But
China
saw
their
luck
desert
them
in
the
second
match
of
the
group
,
crashing
to
a
surprise
2-0
defeat
to
newcomers
Uzbekistan	B	Uzbekistan	Uzbekistan_national_football_team	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan_national_football_team	1032413	/m/03__77
.

China
controlled
most
of
the
match
and
saw
several
chances
missed
until
the
78th
minute
when
Uzbek
striker
Igor
Shkvyrin
took
advantage
of
a
misdirected
defensive
header
to
lob
the
ball
over
the
advancing
Chinese
keeper
and
into
an
empty
net
.

Oleg
Shatskiku
made
sure
of
the
win
in
injury
time
,
hitting
an
unstoppable
left
foot
shot
from
just
outside
the
area
.

The
former
Soviet
republic
was
playing
in
an
Asian
Cup
finals
tie
for
the
first
time
.

Despite
winning
the
Asian
Games
title
two
years
ago
,
Uzbekistan
are
in
the
finals
as
outsiders
.

Two
goals
from
defensive
errors
in
the
last
six
minutes
allowed
Japan
to
come
from
behind
and
collect
all
three
points
from
their
opening
meeting
against
Syria
.

Takuya
Takagi
scored
the
winner
in
the
88th
minute
,
rising
to
head
a
Hiroshige
Yanagimoto
cross
towards
the
Syrian
goal
which
goalkeeper
Salem
Bitar
appeared
to
have
covered
but
then
allowed
to
slip
into
the
net
.

It
was
the
second
costly
blunder
by
Syria
in
four
minutes
.

Defender
Hassan
Abbas
rose
to
intercept
a
long
ball
into
the
area
in
the
84th
minute
but
only
managed
to
divert
it
into
the
top
corner
of
Bitar
's
goal
.

Nader	B	Nader Jokhadar	--NME--
Jokhadar	I	Nader Jokhadar	--NME--
had
given
Syria
the
lead
with
a
well-struck
header
in
the
seventh
minute
.

Japan
then
laid
siege
to
the
Syrian
penalty
area
for
most
of
the
game
but
rarely
breached
the
Syrian
defence
.	B	.

said
:
'
'
The
Syrian
own
goal
proved
lucky
for
us
.

The
Syrians
scored
early
and
then
played
defensively
and
adopted
long
balls
which
made
it
hard
for
us

about
a
comeback
.

"
He
ended
the
World

on
the
wrong

Coste

"
I
thought
it
would
be
useful
to
have
him

now
is

Two
goals
in
the
last
six
minutes
gave
holders
Japan
an
uninspiring
2-1
Asian
Cup
victory
over
Syria
on
Friday
.

Takuya
Takagi
headed
the
winner
in
the
88th
minute
of
the
group
C
game
after
goalkeeper
Salem
Bitar
spoiled
a
mistake-free
display
by
allowing
the
ball
to
slip
under
his
body
.

It
was
the
second
Syrian
defensive
blunder
in
four
minutes
.

Defender
Hassan
Abbas
rose
to
intercept
a
long
ball
into
the
area
in
the
84th
minute
but
only
managed
to
divert
it
into
the
top
corner
of
Bitar
's
goal
.	B	.

Syria
had
taken
the
lead
from
their
first
serious
attack
in
the
seventh
minute
.	B	.

Nader
Jokhadar
headed
a
cross
from
the
right
by
Ammar
Awad
into
the
top
right
corner
of
Kenichi
Shimokawa
's
goal
.	B	.

Japan
then
laid
siege
to
the
Syrian
penalty
area
and
had
a
goal
disallowed
for
offside
in
the
16th
minute
.

A
minute
later
,
Bitar
produced
a
good
double
save
,
first
from
Kazuyoshi
Miura
's
header
and
then
blocked
a
Takagi
follow-up
shot
.

Bitar
saved
well
again
from
Miura
in
the
37th
minute
,
parrying
away
his
header

took
in
last
weekend
's
test
against
Wales
and
retains
his
place
in
the
back-row
ahead

.

The
Wallabies
have
their
sights
set
on
a
13th
successive
victory
to
end
their
European
tour
with
a
100
percent
record
but
also
want
to
turn
on
the
style
and
provide
David
Campese
with
a
fitting
send-off
in
his
final
match
in
Australian
colours
.

The
Wallabies
currently
have
no
plans
to
make
any
special
presentation
to
the
34-year-old
winger
but
a
full
house
of
75,000
spectators
will
still
gather
in
the
hope
of
witnessing
one
last
moment
of
magic
.

Campese
will
be
up
against
a
familiar
foe
in
the
shape
of
Barbarians
captain
Rob
Andrew
,
the
man
who
kicked
Australia
to
defeat
with
a
last-ditch
drop-goal
in
the
World
Cup
quarter-final
in
Cape
Town
.

"
Campo
has
a
massive
following
in
this
country
and
has
had
the
public
with
him
ever
since
he
first
played
here
in

"
said

,
also
likely

making

overhauled

total
of
172
all

with
eight
balls
to

to
end
a
run

57
in

out

during

before
chipping
a
simple
catch
to
Shane

at
mid-wicket
.

West

tour
manager
Clive
Lloyd
has
apologised
for
Lara
's
behaviour
on
Tuesday
.

He
(
Lara
)
had
told

coach
Geoff
Marsh
that
wicketkeeper
Ian
Healy
was
unwelcome
in
the
visitors
'
dressing
room
.

The
Melbourne
crowd
were
clearly
angered
by
the
incident

loudly
jeering

to

together
with
a
gritty

despite
the
handicap
of
an

.

Chanderpaul
was
forced
to
rely

MISERY

MELBOURNE
1996-12-06

West
Indies
batsman
Brian
Lara
suffered
another
blow
to
his
Australian
tour
,
after
already
being
disciplined
for
misconduct
,
when
he
was
dismissed
cheaply
in
the
first
limited
overs
match
against
Australia
on
Friday
.	B	.

who
earned
a
stern
rebuke
from
his
own
tour
management
after
an
angry
outburst
against
Australia
wicketkeeper
Ian
Healy
,
scored
five
to
prolong
a
run
of
poor
form
with
the
bat
.

The
West
Indies
vice-captain
struggled
for
timing
during
his
36-minute
stay
at
the
crease
before
chipping
a
ball
from
medium
pacer
Tom
Moody
straight
to
Shane
Warne
at
mid-wicket
.

West
Indies
were
53
for
two
in
15
overs
when
rain
stopped
play
at
the
Melbourne
Cricket
Ground
after
captain
Courtney
Walsh
won
the
toss
and
elected
to
bat
.	B	.

Lara
's
outburst
three
days
ago
has
clearly
turned
some
of
the
Australian
public
against
him
.

As
he
walked
to
the
wicket
he
was
greeted
by
loud
jeers
from
sections
of
the
crowd
.

On
several
occasions
during
his
innings
,
the
crowd
joined
together
in
a
series
of
obscene
chants
against
him
.

Tour
manager
Clive
Lloyd
on
Wednesday
apologised
for
Lara
's
behaviour
in
confronting
Australia
coach
Geoff
Marsh
in
the
opposition
dressing
room
to
protest
against
his
dismissal
in
the
second
test
on
Tuesday

discipline
would
take

,
was
unhappy
about
Healy
's
role
in
the
incident
and
questioned
whether
the
ball
had
carried
to
the
Australia
keeper
.

Australia
went
on
to
win
the
match
at
the
Sydney
Cricket
Ground
by
124
runs
to
take
a

PRAGUE
1996-12-06

Saturday
's
national
congress
of
the
ruling
Czech
Civic
Democratic
Party
(
ODS
)
will
discuss
making
the
party
more
efficient
and
transparent
,
Foreign
Minister
and
ODS
vice-chairman
Josef
Zieleniec
,
said
on
Friday
.

"
Modernisation
and
more
profesionalism
of
the
party
's
structure
,
having
financing
of
the
party
be
more
transparent
...

are
absolutely
fundamental
,
"
Zieleniec
,
who
is
also
vice-premier
in
the
government
,
told
Reuters	B	Reuters	Reuters	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters	18998750	/m/0ps53
.

He
said
after
June
general
elections
in
which
the
ruling
three-party
coalition
lost
its
parliamentary
majority
,
the
ODS
executive
,
led
by
Prime
Minister
Vaclav
Klaus
,
had
developed
proposals
on
these
subjects
to
present
at
the
congress
on
Saturday
in
the
Czech	B	Czech	Czech_Republic	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic	5321	/m/01mjq
second
city
Brno
.

"
I
am
convinced
,
that
the
congress
will
tackle
these
proposals
,
"
he
said
.

The
ODS
,
a
party
in
which
Klaus
often
tries
to
emulate
the
style
of
former
British
Prime
Minister
Margaret
Thatcher
,
has
been
in
control
of
Czech
politics
since
winning
general
elections
in
1992
.

Zieleniec
in
the
summer
led
calls
for
the
party
and
its
leadership
to
listen
to
more
diverse
opinions
,
a
thinly-veiled
criticism
of
Klaus
who
has
spearheaded
the
country
's
post-Communist
economic
reforms
.

The
party
,
led
by
the
vigorously-confident
Klaus
,
took
32
of
81
seats
after
late
November
runoff
elections
to
the
new
upper
house
of
Czech	B	Czech	Czech_Republic	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic	5321	/m/01mjq
parliament
.

But
after
the
first
round
vote
a
week
before
,
the
ODS
had
the
potential
to
win
as
many
79
seats
.

Klaus
and
his
coalition
lost
its
majority
in
parliament
in
June
lower
house
elections
after
the
left-wing
opposition
consolidated
,
putting
the
centre-left
Social
Democrats
in
a
strong
second-place
position
.

granting

about
53
million
francs

most
of
this
sum
was

however

that
Switzerland
did
get
about
16,000
francs
from
the
so-called

as
part
of
the
compensation

"
About

francs
were
seized
from
accounts

four

five
Polish
citizens
,
whose
data
we
do
not

know

The
issue
is
of
moral

legal
nature

because
its

significance
is
small

Rosati
said

Under

Swiss

devised
a

pay
out

profit
slump
may
last

due

recent

fell

percent
in

despite
a

,
might
only
post
slightly
better
profits
in
1997
before
having
a
chance
to
make
a
more
significant
turnaround
.

So
far
this

whose
full
name
is

has
netted
six
million

It
has
produced
1.5

hectolitres
.

Van	B	Van Boxmeer	--NME--
Boxmeer	I	Van Boxmeer	--NME--
would
not
say
how
much
higher
1997
profits
or
market
share
could
be
but
said
sales
of
leading
Polish	B	Polish	Poland	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland	22936	/m/05qhw
brewers
should
rise
as
the
country
's
young
urban
professionals
gradually
switch
from
vodka
to
beer
.

"
The
perspective
on
growth
is
such
that
reasonably
we
can
think
that
somewhere
between
65
and
80
litres
per
year
is

reachable

per-capita
beer
consumption

currently
around
40

He
said
the
65-80-litre
level
could
be
reached
in
the
next
ten
years
and
make
Poland
,
with
its
40-million

,
Europe

third
largest
beer
market
after
Germany
and
Britain	B	Britain	United_Kingdom	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	31717	/m/07ssc
.

Van
Boxmeer
said
Poland
's
top
five
brewers
,
which
produce
about
55
percent
of
the
country
's
beer
,
could
all
raise
market
share
as
some
of
the
numerous
small
brewers
fall
to
competition
from
the
large
brewers
with
foreign
investors
.

Zywiec	B	Zywiec	--NME--
is
31.8-percent
owned
by
Heineken
while
Carlsberg	B	Carlsberg	Carlsberg_Group	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsberg_Group	325070	/m/01w141
has
the
same
amount
in
Okocim
.

Earlier
this
year
South
African
Breweries
Ltd
(
SAB
)
bought
strategic
stakes
in
the
unlisted
Lech
and
Tychy
brewers
,
which
together
hold
more
than
20
percent
of
the
market
,
and
Australia

Brewpole
BV
has
a
controlling
stake
in
Poland
's
larges
t
brewery
,
Elbrewery
Company
Ltd.
(
EB
)
.

Van
Boxmeer
said
the
tough
competition
had
prevented
Zywiec
from
raising
prices
in
line
with
inflation
,
which
had
added
to
the
pressure
on
the
firm
's
margins
.

He
said
advertising
costs
would
also
increase
in
the
fight
for
market
share
.

But
he
said
the
company
's
investment
of
more
than
$
100
million
already
this
decade
,
largely
in
production
,
would
help
position
it
to
compete
with
such
competitors
as
brewers
from
the
neighbouring
Czech	B	Czech Republic	Czech_Republic	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic	5321	/m/01mjq

.

Some
analysts
say
cheaper
but
high-quality
Czech
imports
could
invade
Poland
once
tariffs
for
CEFTA
countries
are
lifted
in
1998
,
but
van
Boxmeer
says
such
a
threat
might
be
exaggerated
despite
the
Czech
beer
market
's
overcapacity
.

"
I
think
Polish
consumers
in
general
are
quite
proud
of
their
beers
--
and
I
'm
speaking
about
all
the
brands
--
and
as
we
make
good
beers
...

I
think
that
this
fidelity
to
our

is
a
factor
which
can
limit

would

"

His
comments
came
just
minutes
after

ended

London
with
no

signed
.

Industry

said
there
was
no
new
date
for

talks
and
blamed
the
deadlock
on
uncertainty
over
whether
the
British
Airways-American
deal
would
be
cleared
.

The
conditions
for
clearance
of
the
alliance
were
that

New
York
City
on
Friday
said
that
it
planned
a
$
775
million
refunding
for
January
that
will
include
its
first
floating
rate
issue
of
taxable
debt
for
European
investors
.

A
city
official
,
who
declined
to
be
named
,
explained
that
Goldman
,
Sachs
,
which
this
summer
was
demoted
to
the
second
tier
of
the
syndicate
,
proposed
the
floating
rate
issue
and
as
a
result
was
promoted
to
book
runner
for
this
offering
.

By
selling
the
floating
rate
debt
,
the
city
hopes
to
establish
a
benchmark
,
the
city
official
said
,
adding
that
it
needed
a
large
deal
to
accomplish
this
objective
.

The
city
in
late
June
sold
its
first
issue
of
Euronotes
,
a
strategy
that
it
says
saved
it
$
500,000
in
interest
costs
,
and
it
has
been
trying
to
build
on
this
strategy
of
expanding
the
pool
of
potential
investors
since
then
.

In
November
,
New
York
City
said
it
became
the
first
U.S.
municipality
to
offer
bonds
for
sale
in
European
markets
by
competitive
bidding
as
it
listed
taxable
bonds
on
the
London
Stock
Exchange
.

The
refunding
planned
for
January
also
includes
a
$
475
million
tax-exempt
offering
.

No
specific
date
in
January
has
been
selected
for
the
debt
sale
,
the
official
added
.

rejects

suitor
Newmont	B	Newmont Mining Corp	--NME--
Mining	I	Newmont Mining Corp	--NME--

.

Santa

is
so
far
mum
on
the
more
than
$
2
billion
stock
swap
takeover
proposal
from
Newmont
,
announced
Thursday
.

Wall
Street
,
since
the
bid
,
has
speculated
that
any
deal
between
Newmont
and
Santa
Fe
would
be
a
"
bear
hug
,
"
or
a
reluctantly
negotiated
agreement
where
the
buyer
is
not
necessarily
a
friendly
suitor
.

Newmont	B	Newmont	Newmont_Mining_Corporation	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation	1100754	/m/0460n_
said
the
companies
have
had
previous
contact
,
though
declined
to
detail
the
encounters
.

Analysts
predict
Santa	B	Santa Fe	--NME--
Fe	I	Santa Fe	--NME--
will
go
to
the
highest
bidder
,
and
that
if
a
rival
buyer
is
found
,
Newmont
may
not
be
able
to
match
its
offer
.

They
said
the
Santa
Fe
deal
,
which
includes
desirable
Nevada
mining
territory
,
would
only
payoff
for
Newmont	B	Newmont	Newmont_Mining_Corporation	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation	1100754	/m/0460n_
longer
term
.

Newmont
,
in
fact
,
will
not
benefit
from
the
Santa
Fe
acquisition
on
an
earnings
basis
for
at
least
two
years
,
which
also
limits
its
capacity
to
raise
its
offer
.

Any
deal
,
friendly
or
hostile
,
would
almost
assuredly
be
a
stock
swap
,
which
is
necessary
to
preserve
the
tax-free
,
pooling-of-interest
accounting
,
they
said
.

Analysts

arbitrageurs
immediately
ruled
out
Barrick	B	Barrick Gold Corp	--NME--

Cohen	I	Marc Cohen	--NME--
said
he
lowered
his
rating
on
Newmont
to
neutral
from

today
because
if

with
Santa
Fe
,
investors
would
have
to
wait
until
the
second
half
of
1998
to
realize

accretion
.

"
I
think
Homestake	B	Homestake	--NME--
could
come
in
as
a
white
knight
,
but
how
much
is
someone
willing
to
come
in
above
the
Newmont	B	Newmont	Newmont_Mining_Corporation	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation	1100754	/m/0460n_
number
.

One
would
have
to
outbid
by
at
least
15
percent
,
but
there
is
going
to
be
a
(
Santa
Fe
)
deal
with
someone
,
"
he
said
.

"
Longer
term
,
two
to
three
years
out
,
(
a
Newmont-Santa
Fe
deal
)
is
positive
,
it
does
all
the
right
things
.

But
in
the
near-term
it
is
,
at
worst
,
neutral
,
"

added

general
in
charge
of
a
multinational
force
for
eastern
Zaire
said
on
Friday
he
was
going
back
to
Zaire
for
more
information
about
the
plight
of
about
165,000
Rwandan
refugees
adrift
in
the
countryside
.

Lieutenant-General
Maurice
Baril
told
a
news
conference
in
Nairobi
his
main
concern
was
for
a
large
group
of
about
150,000
refugees
living
off
the
land
in
a
valley
about
65
km
(
40
miles
)
west
of
the
eastern
city
of
Goma
.

If
he
decided
it
was
necessary
and
safe
for
the
aircrew
,
he
would
not
hesitate
to
order
airdrops
of
food
for
the
refugees
,
even
against
the
wishes
of
the
government
in
Kinshasa
and
the
Zairean
rebels
who
control
much
of
eastern
Zaire
,
he
said
.

"
Tomorrow
I
'm
going
into
Rwanda
and
my
intention
is
to
go
across
into
eastern
Zaire
and
try
to
find
out
for
the
second
time
what
the
situation
is
on
the
ground
,
"
he
said
.

General
Baril
saw
rebel
leader
Laurent
Kabila
in
Goma
last
week
but
the
rebels
told
him
the
crisis
was
over
because
most
of
the
Rwandan
refugees
have
already
gone
home
.

The
rebels
do
not
want
the
multinational
force
to
deploy
on
the
ground
,
for
fear
it
might
help
the
Zairean
army
regain
control
of
the
area
.

Kinshasa
opposes
airdrops
,
apparently
because
the
food
could
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
rebels
and
their
local
supporters
.

Young	I	Doug Young	Doug_Young	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Young	906034	/m/03np24
said
on
Thursday
that
the
multinational
force
would
probably
not
have
to
make
food
airdrops
or
intervene
militarily
in
any
major
way
.

"
It
does
n't
look
as
though
they
(
airdrops
)
are
going
to
be
required
in
any
significant
way
because
the
NGOs
(
non-governmental
organisations
)
are
in
that
area
on
the
border
between
Zaire
and
Rwanda
,
"
Young
told
reporters
.

But
General
Baril
said
it
would
be
premature
to
rule
out
any
course
of
action
until
he
had
more
information
.

"
We
hope
that
if
the
front
moves
forward
or
stabilises
then
we
will
have
access
(
to
the
large
group
of
refugees
)
with
reconnaissance
or
humanitarian
agencies
.

"
If
they
ca
n't
move
because
they
are
too
weak
,
then
we
will
probably
consider
very
seriously
using
air
delivery
means
(
airdrops
)
...It
's
complex
,
it
's
dangerous
for
the
air
crew
that
fly
in
there
and
it
will
have
to
be
absolutely
necessary
.

If
it
is
necessary
,
I
wo
n't
hesitate
to
use
it
,
"
he
said
.

Asked
if
he
would
disregard
the
objections
of
the
Zairean
government
,
he
said
:
"
It
would
have
to
be
in
the
last
resort
.

It
would
have
to
mean
that
tens
of
thousands
of
lives
are
in
danger
.

Do
you
think
that
I
would
have
a
conscience
problem
doing
it
or
not
at
that
time
?

And
my
mandate
is
also
under
Chapter
Seven
to
operate
in

Zaire
.

"
the
general
added
.

He
denied
that
his
contacts
,
criticised
by
Kinshasa
,
with
the
Zairean
rebels
amounted
to
negotiations
.

"
I
do
n't

"
he
said
.
"

I
coordinate

who
are

that

@

The
ratification
of
the
treaty
,
which
was
signed
in
1993
by
the
then
right-centrist
government
,
is
being
delayed
by
an
ex-communist
party
,
which
won
parliamentary
elections
in

and
now
dominates

The
party
,
the
Democratic

Alliance
,
says
the
agreement
would
give
the
Catholic
Church
too
much
influence
over

in
Poland
and
could
infringe
on
rights
of
other

.

The

Far

an

the

while

it

A

exploded
on
Friday
at
a
mosque
in
the
central
Bulgarian
town
of
Kazanluk
,
causing
damage
but
no
injuries

Violent

has
soared
since
the
collapse
of

in

as
Bulgaria
moves
to

Bombings
are
often
carried

the
motive
in
this
case
was
not

Some

Plastic
surgery
is
booming
,
especially
among
men
,
as
Brazilians
spend
much
of
their
new-found
wealth
on
the
latest
beauty
treatments
,
said
the
organisers
of
a
four-day
international
plastic
surgery
conference
that
opened
on
Friday
.

The
number
of
plastic
surgeries
in
Brazil
has
jumped
30
percent
to
an
estimated
150,000
this
year
since
an
anti-inflation
plan
was
introduced
in
July
1994
,
Farid
Hakme
,
the
president
of
the
Brazilian	B	Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society	--NME--
Plastic	I	Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society	--NME--
Surgery	I	Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society	--NME--
Society	I	Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society	--NME--
(
SBCP
)
,
said
.

The
number
of
operations
on
men
increased
even
more
--
by
80
percent
,
from
8,000
in
1994
to
15,000
in
1995
,
he
said
.

"
Brazil
ranks
right
at
the
top
for
plastic
surgery
with
respect
to
the
number
of
surgeons
,
the
number
of
patients
,
number
of
operations
,
number
of
conferences
.

Our
statistics
are
the
highest
for
everything
,
"
Hakme
said
.

"
We
believe
the
increase
in
plastic
surgeries
for
men
results
from
the
difficulties
in
the
job
market
.

People
need
to
have
a
more
youthful
look
to
compete
in
the
job
market
,
given
the
profound
changes
in
Latin	B	Latin America	Latin_America	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America	18524	/m/04pnx
America	I	Latin America	Latin_America	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America	18524	/m/04pnx
's
economy
.
"

A
controlled
exchange
rate
,
trade
liberalisation
and
tight
monetary
policies
have
also
dramatically
curbed
inflation
,
making
more
money
available
for
cosmetic
surgery
.

Brazil
has
been
at
the
forefront
in
plastic
surgery
for
decades
and
is
home
to
one
of
the
most
famous
surgeons
,
Ivo	B	Ivo Pitangy	--NME--
Pitangy	I	Ivo Pitangy	--NME--
.

There
are
6,000
plastic
surgeons
there
,
of
which
4,500
have
qualified
to
be
members
of
the
SBCP	B	SBCP	--NME--
.

Every
year
,
500
new
plastic
surgeons
graduate
in
Brazil
and
medical
students
from
all
over
the
world
come
to
study
there
.

Hakme	B	Hakme	--NME--
attributes
Brazil
's
fascination
with
plastic
surgery
not
to
excessive
vanity
but
to
the
country
's
mix
and
match
of
different
races
,
which
can
create
physical
disharmonies
.
"

What
happens
is
the
nose
sometimes
does
n't
match
the
mouth
or
the
buttocks
do
n't
match
with
the
legs
,
"
he
said
.	B	.

Brazil
's
most
sought-after
beauty
treatment
is
liposuction
in
which
fat
is
sucked
away
from
areas
of
the
body
,
with
about
30,000
operations
a
year
at
a
cost
of
$
3,000
to
$
4,000
each
.

Stomach
tucks
and
breast
operations
are
also
popular
since
the
tropical
climate
calls
for
flesh-baring
fashions
,
but
unlike
women
elsewhere
Brazilians
tend
to
have
breast
reductions
and
buttock
implants
.

"
The
women
who
want
to
reduce
their
breasts
here
would
probably
want
to
increase
them
in
the
United
States
,
"
SBCP	B	SBCP	--NME--
Vice-President
Oswaldo	B	Oswaldo Saldanha	--NME--
Saldanha	I	Oswaldo Saldanha	--NME--
said
.
"

Beauty
ideals
and
cultures
are
different
in
every
country
.
"

Plastic
surgery
scares
like
the
case
in
which
Brazilian	B	Brazilian	Brazil	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil	3383	/m/015fr
model
Claudia	B	Claudia Liz	--NME--
Liz	I	Claudia Liz	--NME--
fell
into
a
coma
after
being
anaesthetised
for
a
liposuction
in
October
are
not
much
of
a
deterrent
.

Saldanha
said
operations
fell
30
percent
immediately
after
that
case
but
the
rate
was
back
to
normal
now

The

Alatas
said
the

would
have
been

Alatas

:
"

that
is

Alatas
said
on

RANGOON
1996-12-07

Burmese
troops
and

moved
in
to
disperse
a
student
street
protest
at
a
suburban
road
junction
near
the
Ranyon
(
Rangoon
)
University
early
on
Saturday
,
witnesses
said
.

They
said
police
and
troops
used
water
cannons
from
fire
engines
to
subdue
about
120
university
students
sitting
in
at
the
centre
of
the
junction
at
about
3
a.m.
before
they
moved
in
to
round
them
up
.

The
students
,
who
had
staged
an
11-hour
protest
at
the
junction
in
northern
Rangoon
,
were
taken
away
in
three
vehicles
.

The
witnesses
said
some
of
the
students
were
hit
with
batons
while
they
were
herded
onto
the

and
it
was

they
were
taken
to
the
Insein
prison
in

The
protesting
students
,
mostly
from

,
were
demanding
the
right
to
organise
independent
unions
on
campuses
and
the
release
of
about
80
student

.

They

told

by

.

One
of
two
roads
leading
to
the
University
of
Yangon
from
the
institute
had
been
closed
by
authorities
.

But
about
300
university
students
were
still
gathered
outside
the
gates
of
their
campus
,
witnesses
said
.

They
were
singing
peacefully
.

On
Monday
and
Tuesday
,
students
from
the
institute
and
the
university
launched
protests
against
what
they
said
was
unfair
handling
by
police
of
a
brawl
between
some
of
their
colleagues
and
restaurant
owners
in
October
.

On
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
,
opposition
leader
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
was
restricted
to
her
home
by
the
military
government
to
prevent
her
from
being
drawn
into
the
protests
.

She
was
allowed
to
move
freely
on
Thursday
.

The
protest
culminated
at
dawn
on
Tuesday
with
several
hundred
students
being
detained
briefly
by
police
in
central
Rangoon	B	Rangoon	Yangon	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon	57404	/m/0fs54
.

The
street
protests
were
the
biggest
seen
in
the
capital
since
the
student-led
pro-democracry
demonstrations
of
September
1988
when
the
junta
crushed
the
uprising
.

Thousands
were
killed
or
imprisoned
.

Earlier
on
Friday
some
of
the
students
,
who
were
held
briefly
by
police
during
the
protests
earlier
this
week
,
said
they
were
still
dissatisfied
with
the
military
government
.

They
told
Reuters	B	Reuters	Reuters	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters	18998750	/m/0ps53
they
were
unhappy
that
the
ruling
State
Law

Council
(

)
had
not
heeded
their
calls
for
the

answers

.

We
want

"
one
student
said
.

But
the

stressed
their

were
non-political

have
also
denied
any

with

.

But
they
have
said
both
parties
had
a
"
moral
link
"
in
that
they
were
against
police
brutality
and
injustice
.

The
students
also
demanded
the
government
announce
punishments
meted
out
to
policemen
who
they
said
had
manhandled
students
involved
in
a
brawl
with

restaurant
owners
near

institute
in

.

The
students
appealed
to
the
government
not
to
close
the
institute
because
of
their
latest
demonstration
.

The
institute
was
shut
for
nearly
two
years
after

the

Matthew
added
.

"
Though
schemes
designed
to
realise
further
increases
in

of

are
being
operated
successfully
,
the

synthetic

not

but
demand
will
rise

tonnes
.

Matthew
estimates
that
by
the
2000/01
season
,
the
gap
between
natural
rubber
output
and
consumption
will
rise
to
51,000
tonnes
and
319,000
tonnes
in
2010/11
.

Natural
rubber
production
will
go
up
to
695,000
tonnes
in
2000/01
against
consumption
of
746,000
tonnes
.

In
2010/11
,
domestic
demand
should
rise
further
to
1.233
million
tonnes
while
production
will
only
reach
about
914,000

.

One
way
to
bridge
the
widening
gap
is
to
put
more
land
under
cultivation
which
the
Rubber

official
estimates
will
reach
220,000
hectares
between
now
and
the

Comments
by
Japan
's
tight-lipped
central
bank
chief
and
an
influential
top
bureaucrat
are
further
signs
that
the
nation
's
authorities
want
to
keep
the
dollar
at
current
levels
,
market
sources
said
on
Friday
.

In
a
rare
expression
of
a
view
on
currencies
by
the
Bank
of
Japan
(
BOJ
)
governor
,
Yasuo
Matsushita
was
quoted
in
Japan
's
leading
economic
daily
on
Friday
as
saying
that
he
sees
no
further
,
immediate
fall
in
the
yen
.

This
followed
a
widely
watched
television
appearance
late
on
Thursday
by
Eisuke
Sakakibara
,
a
high-ranking
Finance
Ministry
official
,
who
denied
he
had
said
he
wants
to
guide
the
dollar
lower
to
between
108
and
110
yen
.

But
many
in
the
market
thought
Sakakibara
's
real
intentions
lay
elsewhere
,
and
took
more
notice
of
his
comments
about
the
U.S.
government
's
stance
on
the
dollar
,
dealers
said
.

"
I
think
his
views
on
(
U.S.
Treasury
Secretary
Robert
)
Rubin
's
comments
were
indeed
what
he
himself
thinks
about
the
dollar
,
"
said
Hank
Note
,
chief
dealer
at
Sumitomo	B	Sumitomo Bank	The_Sumitomo_Bank	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sumitomo_Bank	1831418	/m/05_g7b
Bank	I	Sumitomo Bank	The_Sumitomo_Bank	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sumitomo_Bank	1831418	/m/05_g7b
.

Asked
about
Rubin
's
comment
that
a
strong
dollar
was
in
U.S.
interests
,
Sakakibara
said
the
remark
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
United
States
supports
a
stronger
dollar
.

"
It
's
a
strong
dollar
,
not
stronger
.

In
that
sense
,
the
comments
are
not
pointing
to
a
certain
direction
,
"
he
said
.

"
It
shows
that
Sakakibara
is
not
for
a
stronger
dollar
either
,
"
said
Sumitomo
's
Note
.

Takao
Sakoh
,
first
vice
president
at
Union
Bank
of
Switzerland
in
Tokyo
,
said
:
"
Maybe
a
dollar
at
104.50
yen
is
not
acceptable
(
to
Sakakibara
)
,
but
it
may
be
okay
at
the
current
level
,
at
the
lower
end
of
112
yen
.
"

Market
participants
have
kept
a
close
eye
on
Sakakibara
,
chief
of
the
ministry
's
International
Finance
Bureau
,
as
a
comment
he
made
in
November
after
the
dollar
hit
this
year
's
high
of
114.92
yen
pushed
the
currency
down
sharply
.

He
had
said
then
that
the
market
's
view
on
Japan
's
economy
was
too
pessimistic
and
that
he
believed
it
was
stronger
than
the
market
thought
.

Dealers
have
come
to
refer
to
115
yen
as
the
"
Sakakibara
ceiling
"
for
the
dollar
following
the
remark
.

Adding
to
the
comments
by
"
Mr
Yen
"
,
as
Sakakibara
is
known
for
his
prominence
in
the
currency
market
,
was
BOJ	B	BOJ	Bank_of_Japan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan	188155	/m/019rb6
governor
Matsushita
's
remark
.

"
The
recent
level
of
the
yen
exchange
rate
has
been
stable
,
and
it
does
not
appear
to
be
moving
towards
a
further
depreciation
of
the
yen
immediately
,
so
import
prices
are
likely
to
stabilise
at
current
levels
,
"
Matsushita
said
in
an
interview
with
the
Nihon	B	Nihon Keizai Shimbun	Nihon_Keizai_Shimbun	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Keizai_Shimbun	193064	/m/01bf0h

.

"
The
fact
that
he
touched
on
the
issue
of
inflation
triggered
by
import
prices
shows
that
the
BOJ
does
not
want
a
further
depreciation
of
the
yen
,
past
115
yen
,
"
said
Yasuhito
Kawashima
,
chief
forex
manager
at

Trust
&
Banking
Co
.

Some
said
the
central
bank
may
have
been
concerned
a
weaker
yen
would
lead
to
unfounded
pessimism
about
Japan	B	Japan	Japan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	15573	/m/03_3d

There

on

sentenced
to

in

the
commander
of
Israel
's
surrogate
militia
in
south
Lebanon
on
treason
charges
.

The
court
convicted
General
Antoine
Lahd
,
head
of
the
South
Lebanon
Army
(
SLA
)
,
of
collaborating
with
Israel
with
which
Lebanon

at
war

militia
which
helps
Israel
hold
a
border
zone
in
south
Lebanon
to
ward
off
cross-frontier
guerrilla
raids
on
northern
Israel
.

Lahd
said
a
few
days
after
the
trial
began
on
February
16
that
Lebanese
authorities
must
drop
the
charges
or
risk
blocking
any
peace
deal
with
the
Jewish	B	Jewish	Jews	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews	25955086	/m/041rx
state
.

He
said
Israel
was
capable
of
pressuring
Lebanon
's
Syrian-backed	B	Syrian-backed	--NME--
government
to
stop
the
legal
pursuit
.

The
charges
against
Lahd
were
:
forming
a
hostile
army
,
carrying
weapons
on
Israel
's
side
,
helping
Israel
strip
off
a
part
of
Lebanese
territory
by
violence
,
forming
an
armed
gang
,
killing
or
trying
to
kill
Lebanese
civilians
by
artillery
shelling
and
kidnapping
Lebanese
citizens
for
long
periods
.

Shortly
before
Lahd
's
trial
began
,
a
Beirut
military
prosecutor
charged
another
89
former
Lebanese
army
soldiers
with
collaborating
with
Israel
.

No
date
has
been
set
for
the
trial
of
the
men
,
all
members
of
the
SLA
living
in
the
Israeli-held
zone
in
south
Lebanon
.

Israel	B	Israel	Israel	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel	9282173	/m/03spz
and
Lahd
have
repeatedly
demanded
safety
guarantees
for
the
SLA
--
a
mixed
Christian-Shi'ite
Moslem
force
--
which
the
Jewish
states
regards
as
loyal
allies
.

Israel	B	Israel	Israel	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel	9282173	/m/03spz

said
the
Lebanese
army
must
incorporate
the
SLA
fighters
into
its
ranks
as
an
army
brigade
as
a
condition
for
peace
.

But
Lebanese
political
analysts
have
said
that
would
be
out
of
the
question
and
Lebanese
authorities
pre-empted
the
issue
by
taking
legal
action
against
Lahd
.

Former
Israeli	B	Israeli	Israel	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel	9282173	/m/03spz

Lahd
"

"
,
said
earlier
this
year
Lebanon
had
insulted
the
SLA
commander

ordering

arrest

Peres

,
said
there

Fourteen
years
after
he
bludgeoned
and
shot
a
man
whose
trailer
home
he
robbed
in
1982
,
John
Mills
Jr
.

,
41
,
was
put
to
death
in
Florida
's
electric
chair
Friday
.

As
Glenn
Lawhon
,
a
rural
Florida
minister
who
is
the
victim
's
father
,
looked
on
,
Mills
was
pronounced
dead
at
7:13
a.m.
EST
(
1213
GMT
)
for
the
murder
of
Lester
Lawhon
.

Speaking
in
Arabic
,
Mills	B	Mills	--NME--
made
a
final
statement
before
an
anonymous
citizen
flipped
the
switch
that
sent
2000
volts

through
his
body
,

of	I	Department of Corrections	--NME--

spokesman
Eugene
Morris
,
who
was
present
at
the
execution
.

"
I
bear
witness
that
there
is
no
God
but
Allah
and
I
bear
witness
that
the
prophet
Mohammed
is
the
messenger
of
God
,
"
he
quoted
Mills
as
saying
.

Prison
officials
said
they
had
no
record
of
Mills
'
official
conversion
,
but
they
said
that
,
on
May
14
,
1991
,
he
had
asked
that
a
new
name
,
Yuhanna
Abdullah
Muhammed
,
be
added
to
his
prison
file
,
which
is
usually
an
indication
of
a
conversion
to
Islam
.

Mills	B	Mills	--NME--
is
the
38th
person
to
die
in
Florida
's
electric
chair
since
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
reversed
itself
in
1976
and
legalised
the
death
penalty
.

Prison
officials
said
Mills	B	Mills	--NME--
made
no
special
request
for
a
last
meal
and
did
not
eat
the
steak
,
fried
potatoes

offered
him
.

He
spent
Thursday
with
family
members
and
his
spiritual

,
Morris
said
.

Mills	B	Mills	--NME--
was
scheduled
to
die
Wednesday
but
had
his
sentence
temporarily
postponed

"
he
said
.

Cornwell
said
50
percent
of
reported
bites
were
provoked
by
a
person
and
60
percent
were
suffered
by
children
.

He
also
estimated
that
only
25
percent
of
bites
were
reported
because
medical
attention
was
not
needed
.

Don
Rieck
,
president
of
the
National
Animal
Control
Association
,
said
aggressiveness
in
dogs
was
related
more
to
gender
than
breed
and
a
male
dog
that
had
not
been
neutered
was
three
times
more
likely
to
bite
than
an
unspayed
female
.

The
five
breeds
credited
with
the
most
incidents
were
chow
chows
,
Rottweilers
,
German	B	German shepherds	German_Shepherd_Dog	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Shepherd_Dog	79289	/m/0km5c

Dalmatians	B	Dalmatians	Dalmatian_\u0028dog\u0029	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_(dog)	19255892	/m/02rjc05
.
"

The
trends
in
dog
bites
by
particular
breeds
have
more
to
do
with
fad
pets
owned
by
individuals
who
need
to
have
something
unique
.

Speaking
strictly
of
dogs
,
15
years
ago
the
macho
fad
pet
was
a
Doberman
.

Today
,
Rottweilers	B	Rottweilers	--NME--
are
on
the
way
up
,
"
Rieck
said
.

If
approached
by
a
stray
dog
,
children
should
be
taught
to
stand
still
with
fists
folded
underneath
the
neck
,
elbows
in
,
and
gaze
forward
until
the
dog
goes
away
.

1996-12-06

In
a
gloomy
Geneva
conference
centre
built
before
the
dawn
of
the
Internet	B	Internet	World_Wide_Web	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web	33139	/m/0828v
,
groups
of
staid
officials
made
a
first
stab
on
Friday
at
rewriting
copyright
laws
for
the
digital
age
.

But
critics
at
the
first
government-level
meeting
to
revise
copyright
laws
in
25
years
said
the
officials
and
legislators
might
as
well
be
trying
to
police
the
ether
.

After
four
days
of
diplomatic
wrangling
over
procedures
,
some
600
delegates
from
nations
small
and
large
got
down
to
the
nitty-gritty
of
setting
the
digital
agenda
for
the
first
time
.

Cyberspace
squabbles
overshadowed
the
debate
on
a
stack
of
proposals
covering
literary
and
artistic
works
,
the
rights
of
performers
and
producers
of
music
and
producers
of
databases
.

"
If
it
goes
on
like
this
,
we
wo
n't
have
enough
time
to
finish
all
the
discussions
,
"
a
frustrated
Western
delegate
said
.
"

They
announced
they
will
start
evening
sessions
next
week
.
"

Attempts
by
copyright-based
industries
to
ensure
they
get
a
cut
from
online
works
led
to
a
storm
of
protests
by
Internet
companies
and
critics
who
say
the
pacts
would
curb
public
access
to
online
information
from
soccer
results
to
stock
prices
.

"
It
's
not
illegal
to
make
photocopies
of
newspaper
articles
.

It
's
fair
use
.

We
can
read
sports
statistics
or
stock
prices
.

But
with
the
treaty
,
this
kind
of
fact
will
be
owned
and
subject
to
licensing
,
"
said
James
Love
,
a
consumer
lobbyist
heading
the	B	the Washington-based
Washington-based	I	the Washington-based
Consumer
Project
on
Technology
.

"
None
of
the
treaties
are
ready
to
move
.

These
people
do
n't
understand
what
they
're
doing
.
"

At
stake
are
billions
of
dollars
and
the
future
of
the
electronic
information
industry
--
the
coming
medium
for
the
distribution
of
music
,
films
,
literature
,
software
and
commerce
.

Supporters
of
the
three
pacts
say
they
are
only
an
extension
of
existing
intellectual
property
rights
,
covered
by
the
century-old
Berne
Convention
.

But
an
array
of
opponents
from
the
network
industry
to
consumer
,
scientific
and
academic
groups
say
the
pacts
will
give
sweeping
powers
to
entertainment
and
copyright-based
industries
.

A
quick
survey
at
the
conference
centre
found
few
officials
who
had
actually
surfed
the
Internet
.

Mongolia
's
state
copyright
official
,
Gundegma
Jargalshaihan
,
said
apologetically
that
he
had
just
arrived
from
Ulan
Bator
and
was
not
aware
of
the
details
of
the
digital

.

he
added
.

Alexander

legal
chief
at
Russia

,
said
Moscow
had
yet
to
formulate
a
policy
on

.

He
too
had
never
browsed
the

"

I
?

There
are
lots
of
other
things
in

he
said
.

European

away
on

Scalfaro

Scalfaro
was
in
Mantua
to
attend
a
ceremony
commemorating
the
executions
there
by
Austrian
rulers
in
1852
and
1853
of
a
group
of
Italians
who
had
campaigned
for
national
unity
.

He
was
jeered
and
whistled
at
by
a
small
group
of
League
supporters
when
he
arrived
for
a
visit
marked
by
heavy
security
.

Witnesses
said
the
protesters
were
outnumbered
by
other
Italians
who
waved
tricolour
flags
in
the
national
red
,
white
and
green
or
shouted
"
Viva
Italia
"
.

The
League
won
more
than
eight
percent
of
votes
at
the
last
general
election
in

platform

CANBERRA
1996-12-06

The
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	4689264	/m/0chghy
opposition
on
Friday
demanded
a
high-powered
investigation
into
paedophilia
in
the
Australian
diplomatic
service
after
the
federal
court
forced
the
head
of
the
existing
inquiry
to
stand
aside
.

The
court
said
inquiry
head
Chris
Hunt
might
be
biased
,
since
he
privately
told
a
newspaper
he
had
turned
up
no
major
evidence
of
paedophile
activity
,
even
though
he
still
had
months
'
of
investigation
before
him
.

"
Today
we
are
left
with
a
ruinous
wreck

a
continuing
pall
of
doubt
and
suspicion
hanging
over
our
diplomatic
service
,
"
opposition
foreign
affairs
spokesman
Laurie
Brereton
said
.

But
the
government
responded
by
pressing
ahead
with
the
original
inquiry
,
established
in
May
,
appointing
a
new
head
to
lead
it
.

Critics
say
that
if
there
were
many
paedophiles
in
senior
posts
in
the
Foreign
Affairs
Department
then
a
secret
inquiry
would
be
open
to
internal
influence
and
would
become
a
public
service
whitewash
.

Accordingly
,
they
demand
an
open
investigation
.

A

for
Foreign
Affairs
Minister
Alexander
Downer
said
the
appointment
of
a
new
inquiry
head
,
administrative
law
expert

On

what
they
called

handling
by

a

between
some
of
their
colleagues
and

in

.

The

's
winning
campaign
to
host
the
World
Trade
Organisation
(
WTO
)
's
first
ministerial
meeting
reflected
its
ambition
to
play
a
key
role
in
shaping
global
free
trade
,
the
lifeblood
of
its
economy
,
analysts
said
.

"
As
one
of
the
world
's
most
externally
oriented
economies
,
Singapore
has
a
disproportionately
large
stake
in
the
WTO
,
"
said
Desmond
Supple
,
economist
at
research
house
I.D.E.A	B	I.D.E.A	--NME--
.

"
Singapore
stands
to
benefit
more
than
most
from
continued
global
trade
liberalisation
as
trade
is
the
engine
of
its
growth
,
accounting
for
nearly
three
times
its
gross
domestic
product
.
"

The
city-state
met
U.S.
opposition
two
years
ago
in
its
bid
to
host
the
meeting
,
expected
to
gather
4,000
officials
from
160
countries
from
December
9
to
13
.

In
a
stand
some
analysts
linked
to
controversy
over
Singapore
's
caning
of
an
American
teenager
for
vandalism
,
then-U.S.
Trade
Representative
Mickey
Kantor
had
said
the
meeting
ought
to
be
held
where
the
WTO
was
going
to
be
headquartered
.

That
would
have
meant
Geneva
.

But
Singapore
had
the
support
of
other
WTO
members
.

Derek
da
Cunha
,
senior
fellow
at
the
Institute
of
Policy
Studies
(
ISEAS	B	ISEAS	--NME--
)
,
said
Singapore
's
hosting
of
the
conference
"
carries
a
great
deal
of
symbolism
for
the
city-state
,
underscoring
its
commitment
to
free
trade
and
its
trading
links
across
the
globe
.
"

There
is
the
international
prestige
Singapore
would
enjoy
,
but
"
more
importantly
there
is
a
genuine
national
interest
in
fostering
better
global
free
trade
and
an
open
market
"
,
said
Tan
Kong
Yam
,
head
of
Business
Policy
at
the
National
University
of
Singapore
.

At
the
ministerial
meeting
,
trade
ministers
will
review
the
work
of
the
WTO
and
the
implementation
of
the
Uruguay
Round
free
trade
commitments
under
its
predecessor
the
General
Agreement
on
Tariffs
and
Trade
(
GATT
)
.

In
June
,
the
WTO	B	WTO	World_Trade_Organization	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization	33873	/m/085h1
hailed
Singapore
for
its
open
market
policies
but
the
European
Union
and
other
trading
powers
called
on
Singapore
to
speed
up
the
opening
of
its
services
sector
.	B	.

Supple	B	Supple	--NME--
said
the
struggle
that
Singapore
had
to
wage
in
vying
to
host
the
meeting
would
be
repeated
during
the
talks
.

"
There
is
tension
at
every
step
of
the
way
,
"
since
a
battle
line
between
the
West
and
developing
countries
has
been
drawn
over
the
issue
of
linking
trade
liberalisation
with
labour
rights
,
he
said
.

Supple
said
hosting
the
meeting
carried
prestige
for
Singapore
,
"
however
,
this
is
quite
intangible
as
the
prestige
factor
may
not
necessarily
lead
to
any
additional
investment
and
trade
flows
to
this
region
.
"

From
a
commercial
point
of
view
,
the
meeting
would
be
good
for
Singapore
's
tourism
industry
,
Tan
said
.

A
large
part
of
Singapore
's
workforce
would
be
mobilised
to
ensure
the
meeting
would
run
without
a
glitch
but
the
average
Singaporean
"
would
probably
not
be
too
concerned
about
some
of
the
issues
,
"
Tan
said
.

"
But
the
more
educated
public
will
realise
that
these
kind
of
things
are
important
for
Singapore
as
a
small
economy
.
"

Supple	B	Supple	--NME--
said
any
political
gains
the
Singapore
government
would
get
from
the
WTO
meeting
--
ahead
of
a
general
election
due
by
April
1997
--
would
depend
on
how
successful
it
was
in
pushing
its
economic
agenda
.

"
If
there
are
any
movements
toward
freer
trade
,
then
Singapore
's
economy
and
the
electorate
would
gain
,
"
he
said
.
"

But
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
wise
to
play
up
the
political
aspect
of
this
.

I
think
political
issues
will
take
secondary
importance
to
all
these
economic
issues
that
will
be
displayed
.

TOKYO

Nippon
Telegraph

Corp
(
NTT
)
said
on
Friday
that
it
hopes
to
move
into
the
international
telecommunications
business
as
soon
as
possible
following
the
government
's
decision
to
split
NTT
into
three

under

.

"
We
hope
to
start
international
telephone
business
as
soon
as
possible
,
"
a
company
official
told
Reuters
.

The
official
said
the
latest
government
decision
to
split
the
company
under
a
holding
company
would
allow
flexibility
in
NTT
's

business
.

told
a

the

plans
to
split
NTT
into
three
firms
under
a
holding
company
,
but
did
not
specify
when
the
restructuring
would
likely
take
effect
.

One
of
the
three
new
companies
will
be
a
long-distance
operator
and
the
other
two
will
be
local-call
operators
,
Horinouchi
said
.

One
of
the
local
firms
will
operate
in
west
Japan
and
the
other
in
east
Japan
,
he
added
.

The
long-distance
operator
will
offer
international
services
,
Horinouchi
said
.

The
NTT	B	NTT	--NME--
official
said
the
timing
of
the
planned
split-up
was
uncertain
because
more
discussions
by
government
officials
were
required
.

World
Cup
ski
officials
hope
to
be
able
to
get
in
at
least
one
men
's
downhill
training
run
on
Saturday
in
an
effort
to
salvage
the
weekend
racing
programme
.

For
the
third
consecutive
day
,
Friday
's
scheduled
training
runs
were
cancelled
due
to
heavy
wet
snow
and
fog
on
Whistler
Mountain
,
leaving
the
scheduled
World
Cup
events
in
jeopardy
.

Rules
call
for
at
least
one
training
run
to
be
completed
before
a
World
Cup
downhill
race
can
be
staged
.

Organisers
hope
to
get
that
run
in
on
Saturday
morning
,
conditions
permitting
,
and
stage
the
race
later
in
the
day
or
on
Sunday
.

"
There
was
no
possibility
today
to
make
a
training
run
,
"
said
Bernd
Zobel
,
the
Canadian
men
's
national
coach
,
citing
too
much
new
snow
and
poor
visibility
.

If
organisers
are
forced
to
run
the
downhill
on
Sunday
,
the
super-giant
slalom
originally
scheduled
for
Sunday
would
likely
be
abandoned
.

rugby
in

but
looks
more
likely
to
spend
the
next
year
chasing
business
opportunities
in
Australia
.

The
34-year-old
winger
played
his
final
game
in
a
Wallaby
jersey
on
Saturday
but
is
currently
a
target
for
clubs
eager
to
match
London
side
Saracens
who
have
already
snapped
up
Francois
Pienaar
,
Michael
Lynagh
and
Philippe
Sella
.

"
If
the
opportunity
is
there
I
'd
obviously
think
about
it
but
the
thing
that
holds
me
back
is
business
,
"
said
Campese
.

"
I
'd
like
to
come
over
but
there
are
a
lot
of
things
happening
at
home
.

I
've
also
got
a
contract
to
play
for
New
South
Wales
in
the
Super
12
next
year
.

bade
farewell
to
David
Campese
in
spectacular
fashion
by
overwhelming
the
Barbarians
39-12
in
the
final
match
of
their
European
tour
at
Twickenham
on
Saturday
.

The
Wallabies
ran
in
five
tries
with
Campese
,
who
has
retired
from
test
rugby
after
collecting
101
caps
and
a
world
record
64
tries
,
adding
one
last
touchdown
in
a
Wallaby
jersey
before
departing
the
international
game
.

The
Barbarians
included
14
internationals
but
,
with
only
two
pre-match
practice
sessions
behind
them
,
proved
no
real
match
for
a
Wallaby
side
determined
to
finish
their
12-match
tour
unbeaten
.

The
touring
team
were
27-0
ahead
by
half-time
before
easing
up
in
the
second-half
.

Full-back
Matthew
Burke
finished
with
a
personal
haul
of
24
points
to
take
his
tour
aggregate
to
136
.

lifted
suspensions
on
various
soccer
officials
.

FIFA	B	FIFA	FIFA	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA	11049	/m/02zm3
had
banned
Albania
indefinitely
after
its
sports
ministry
had
ordered
the
suspension
of
Albanian
Football
Association
general
secretary
Eduard
Dervishi

.

"
We
would
be
very
happy
with
a
draw
in
Belfast
,
"
said
Hafizi
.
"

Especially
if
one
takes
into
consideration
our
difficult
post-suspension
situation
and
the
fact
Northern
Ireland
is
very
keen
to
win
.

star
right
wing
Pavel
Bure
was
suspended
for
one
game
by
the
National
Hockey
League
and
fined
$
1,000
Friday
for
his
hit
on
Buffalo
Sabres
defenceman
Garry
Galley
on
Wednesday
.

Bure
received
a
double-minor
penalty
for
high-sticking
with
2:22
left
in
the
first
period
of
Wednesday
's
7-6
overtime
win
by
Vancouver
after
colliding
with
Galley
in
Buffalo
zone
.

Galley	B	Galley	Garry_Galley	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Galley	3438109	/m/09cd7_
suffered
a
concussion
and
did
not
return
to
the
game
.

"
Mr
Bure
left
his
feet
to
deliver
a
forearm
blow
to
Mr
Galley
as
he
was
about
to
be
checked
legally
by
his
opponent
,
"
said
NHL
discipline
chief
Brian
Burke
in
handing
out
the
suspension
.

"
Although
it
is
clear
from
the
videotape
that
Mr
Bure
's
actions
were
a
reaction
to
the
impending
hit
and
there
was
no
intent
to
injure
his
opponent
,
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
this
type
of
conduct
,
"
Burke
said
.

Bure
,
who
is
struggling
with
only
nine
goals
and
12
assists
in
26
games
,
will
miss
Saturday
's
home
game
against
Ottawa
.

"
The
years
I
spent
as
manager
of
the
Republic
of
Ireland
were
the
best
years
of
my
life
.

It
all
culminated
in
the
fact
that
I
now
have
lots
of
great
,
great
friends
in
Ireland
.

That
is
why
this
is
so
emotional
a
night
for
me
,
"
Charlton
said
.

"
It
was
the
joy
that
we
all
had
over
the
period
,
that
I
shared
with
people
that
I
grew
to
love
,
that
I
treasure
most
,
